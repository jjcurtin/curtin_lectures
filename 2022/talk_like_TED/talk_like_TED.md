# Todays outline
* Talk about the process
* What I learned
* What will port to academic talks vs. unique to TED (broad, lay audience) presentation
* What can we all do to become better presenters?
* How important is it to present well?

# Overview of the process
 
 * How selected?
    * Lots of TEDx venues
    * TEDx Oshkosh led by vet
    * Found me through search of NIH reporter
    * Can apply directly with idea

* Focus on core idea
    * First draft - 45 minutes based on talk I gave frequently
	* What, so what, now what?
	* Use of stories
	* Why passionate about idea
	* Emotionally evocative (not as goal but as tool to support connection, engagement, and retention of ideas)
	* Only a few, simple/powerful statistics at most
	* Cut, cut, cut

* Discuss with others
	* Met frequently with lab (4x?)
	* Put drafts in front of family, academic friends, non-academic friends
	* Continue to cut
	
* Body language and theater coach
	* No pacing, no rocking, stay put  (still had distracting head motions!)
	* Energy through hands and upper body
	* Change in tone (wide range)
	* Decide how/where to use gesture and tone

* Visuals
	* Discourage use generally
	* If presentation is clear, most not needed
	* If looking at complex visuals, not listening to you
	* VERY FEW words.  NO bullet points.
	* Evocative images OK
	* Simple data figures - BUT SIMPLE
	
* Practice, practice, practice
	* 2x per day for month
	* Present to others (TEDx team, lab, CHESS, kids, neighbors, dog)
	* No practice in venue which was unfortunate!

# What will port to academic setting?
 
## What, So What, Now What?
 
* Narrative arc
* What? - Why should we care?
* So what? - Not just a review of what you have done
* Now what? - Not just a list of future studies or questions
* See TED speaker guide point 3

## Stories

* Why are you passionate? Why should audience be passionate?
* Doesn't need to be personal (though there are benefits RE connection with audience)  Vulnerability helps connect
* Stories make abstract ideas real/concrete, important
* Stories vs. jargon?
* Present the "What"
 	* Access, acceptability, availability
* Return to the story where appropriate
	* Treatments
	* Personal sensing example
	* Ending
* Thoughts on use in academic setting?

## Statistics and slides

* See TED speaker guide point 4
* Example of where I started RE the "What"
* What statistics are important for academic audience?
* Bullet points in Powerpoint
* Complex tables?
* Use of evocative images?

## Draft, Feedback and Practice?	

* TED speaker guide point 5
* Can't do the TED model for every talk
* Many of us give variants of the same talk repeatedly.  Iterate and improve
* Take every chance to present in low stakes settings (lab,  lunch and learn, clinical research symposium, mentoring committee

# Is it important?

* Neither necessary nor sufficient but......
	* Networking, establish as expert in field
	* Clarify your ideas for other products (grants, papers)
	* Teaching
