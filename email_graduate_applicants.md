Hi INSERT NAME,

Thank you for the interest in our clinical program and my research group.  I do plan to review applications this year.  However, you should know that I am not 100% committed to accepting a new graduate student this cycle.  It is possible that I will, but it is also possible that I will wait for another year to recruit.  This decision will be based on both funding and the fit/experiences/interests of specific applicants.  I am primarily looking for applicants that are interested in projects related to the current NIDA R01 in my lab (https://arc.psych.wisc.edu/lapse-risk-opioid/).  If that work is of interest to you, you should apply.

Best, John
