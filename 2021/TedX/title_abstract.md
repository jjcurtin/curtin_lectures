**Digital Disruptions in Mental Healthcare: Promise, Progress, and Pitfalls**


# Brief Abstract

Our mental healthcare system is broken.  Treatments are expensive, access is limited, outcomes are modest at best, and large disparities exist by race and class.

Two technological innovations may fundamentally shift how we support people with mental illness.  Digital therapeutics can provide highly scalable, cost efficient treatment and other supports that are available 24/7 without geographic constraints.  Personal sensing allows digital therapeutics to deliver supports that are tailored to the specific needs of the person and the moment in time.

This talk explores the opportunities that these two technological innovations provide and the obstacles that must be overcome to reduce mental health disparities and improve outcomes for everyone.
