# early cuts from intro materials

Specifically, I believe that AI, machine learning and related technologies are on the verge of producing a disruptive change in how we identify and treat psychiatric disorders.  

There are a number of related efforts in this area but I want to highlight two efforts that are far enough along to generate some excitement.

Talk about each briefly



I want to propose that a key feature of these new approaches is that they SCALE very well to increase capacity to provide interventions.  And with adequate SCALE, their effectiveness can be modest and they will still provide substantial aggregate benefit to reduce suffering from a population  health perspective.

Can address: 
cost [b/c they are inexpensive to implement and may reduce need of expensive time from therapists]

stigma (private, self directed)

Aid early diagnosis (efficient/massive diagnosis)

Improve effectiveness (could improve interventions by adapting to the person and moment in time)

I also want to emphasize that I am not talking about replacing human therapists.    These are primarily new tools that clinicians can use to supplement or augment the mental health services that they are providing.
