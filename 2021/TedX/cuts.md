# early cuts from intro materials

Specifically, I believe that AI, machine learning and related technologies are on the verge of producing a disruptive change in how we identify and treat psychiatric disorders.  

There are a number of related efforts in this area but I want to highlight two efforts that are far enough along to generate some excitement.

Talk about each briefly



I want to propose that a key feature of these new approaches is that they SCALE very well to increase capacity to provide interventions.  And with adequate SCALE, their effectiveness can be modest and they will still provide substantial aggregate benefit to reduce suffering from a population  health perspective.

Can address: 
cost [b/c they are inexpensive to implement and may reduce need of expensive time from therapists]

stigma (private, self directed)

Aid early diagnosis (efficient/massive diagnosis)

Improve effectiveness (could improve interventions by adapting to the person and moment in time)

I also want to emphasize that I am not talking about replacing human therapists.    These are primarily new tools that clinicians can use to supplement or augment the mental health services that they are providing.


<!--Let me start with some sobering statements.  We have a mental healthcare crisis in the United States.  Our need for mental health services is alarmingly high and the practical capacity of our healthcare system to meet this need is woefully inadequate.-->

<!--We all know this story because its the story of our family members, our friends, for some of us, ourselves.-->


# VA materials from focused draft

<!-- Draft image;  Need to consider which apps to highlight. Consider apps featured in https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6087876/#!po=78.1250; apps are here: https://mobile.va.gov/appstore/all -->

Our nation's largest integrated health care system, the Veterans Health Administration, has been at the forefront of this implementation effort.  

The VA has developed and distributed a suite of 20 digital therapeutics that provide evidence-based treatments and self-management strategies for mental illness.  

These digital therapeutics are targeted at veterans but the VA makes them freely available to everyone.  




# Pitfalls cuts

These goals are possible, if not today, in the coming years as we continue to develop smart digital therapeutics. However, there are no guarantees and numerous pitfalls exist that we must avoid. 

To my eye, the greatest obstacles emerge from tensions among three related issues:

 1. How we regulate digital therapeutics to assure their safety and effectiveness, 
 2. How we distribute them to patients
 3. And who pays for them

<!-- Wild west image -->
Currently, the world of digital health more broadly is a bit like the Wild West.  There are over 350k digital health apps available for download in app stores on our smartphones. Many of these apps have little or no evidence of their effectiveness.  And privacy risks become paramount as more and more apps incorporate personal sensing of our sensitive data.

Fortunately, the FDA has begun to recognize the need for regulation and to clarify its planned approach.  The FDA does not plan to regulate the broad category of digital health apps that are intended to maintain or encourage a healthy
lifestyle.  However, they do plan to provide regulatory oversight for the narrower class of digital therapeutics that are used to diagnose, treat or manage disease including mental illness.  In fact, in 2018 the FDA cleared the first digital therapeutic for substance use disorders based in part on evidence of its effectiveness.  

This is an important first step but FDA oversight is not sufficient because patients may not always be aware of their guidance or the subtle distinctions between a digital health app and a digital therapeutic.

Mental healthcare providers may serve as an important and trustworthy conduit of safe and effective digital therapeutics to their patients. However, if digital therapeutics are only available through healthcare providers we may miss the opportunity to address mental health disparities among vulnerable groups who are uninsured or don't otherwise have access to healthcare.

---

The VA offers an interesting model where they provide their own digital therapeutics directly through the VA website, but free to everyone.  This allows them to recommend and broadly distribute digital therapeutics that are safe and effective.  

However, as smart digital therapeutics become more expensive to develop, evaluate, and maintain, it is not clear who will pay these expenses if they are freely distributed.  

Some of the most promising digital therapeutics for substance use disorders have resulted from academic/commercial partnerships but these therapeutics are not free.  

---

We also need to tackle issues that arise from scale.  Digital therapeutics are highly scalable given that many of their supports are not dependent on human clinicians but software.  This scale can address key issues with access and availability that are serious problems for traditional mental healthcare with human clinicians.  Their scale can also control mental healthcare costs.  

Unfortunately, scale comes with risks as well. As digital therapeutics scale, there may economic pressures to limit access to or even replace human clinicians.  We must resist this impulse that could compromise outcomes in favor of lower costs.

The scale of digital therapeutics may also further homogenize mental healthcare by providing the same interventions to all patients.  To be clear, this is already a problem for traditional mental healthcare interventions which have primarily been developed and evaluated with white patients.  However, to the degree that there is recognition of this problem and some diversity across human clinicians, their interventions are tailored at times to be culturally appropriate for communities of color and other minority groups.  We have an opportunity to intentionally recruit clinicians of color to re-imagine these new and modified interventions that are delivered by digital therapeutics so that they are acceptable for everyone. 

# Digital agents and acceptability

<!-- Need to simplify the language here-->

On the more leading edge, there has been recent rapid developments of virtual relational agents that use natural language processing to communicate more naturally while providing support for mental illnesses.

For example, Woebot is a chatbot designed by Stanford-trained researchers and psychologists.  Woebot uses brief, text-based conversations and tools based on CBT and related interventions to provide psycho-education and guided support.

By their very nature, all of these digital therapeutics on smartphones can be accessible and available, everywhere you go, 24/7.  But, equally important, many patients appear to find digital therapeutics acceptable.

For example, the VAs digital therapeutic for post-traumatic stress disorder, a single app in their suite of 20 digital therapeutics, has been downloaded more than a half million times across 115 countries.  And over 60% of its users engaged with it on multiple occasions. 

<!-- in the last week of March 2020 more than 750,000 Apple iOS users downloaded MBI apps (Kellen & Saxena, 2020)  https://aisel.aisnet.org/iceb2020/43/ -->

In fact, digital therapeutics may be more than just acceptable.  When chatbots or other virtual agents are included, patients may form real connections with them.  

In a recent study, over 36,000 adults who received digital cognitive behavioral therapy from Woebot described their therapeutic bond in terms typically reserved only for human therapists.  Patients frequently endorsed statements like:

* Woebot likes me.
* Woebot and I respect each other.
* Woebot appreciates me.
* Woebot cares about me even when I do things that they do not approve of.

---

Other studies has observed that patients self-disclose more, display their sadness more,  and do less impression management when interacting with virtual agents rather than human therapists.

<!--Alison Darcy, the developer of Woebot, has noted that this ability to establish a bond, and to do so with millions of people simultaneously, is the secret to unlocking the  vast potential of digital therapeutics-->
