https://commed.umassmed.edu/blog/2021/04/20/catching-next-wave-advancing-health-care-digital-therapeutics
The next wave of patient care is upon us: digital therapeutics (DTx) – evidence-based, clinically evaluated software products that treat, manage, and prevent diseases.1 The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) estimated that 325,000 health care applications were available in 2017, resulting in approximately 3.7 billion mobile health application downloads over one year worldwide.2 With the global DTx market expected to grow between $6 and $9 billion by 2025, many major pharmaceutical companies have created in-house digital health teams or teamed up with digital health manufacturers to consider how DTx products can be integrated into disease management and provide an alternative form of therapeutic intervention for patients.2-5

A subset of digital health, DTx delivers therapeutic interventions directly to patients via different domains (e.g., virtual reality technologies, mobile applications, and artificial intelligence-powered assistants). Unlike digital health, DTx products require clinical evidence and clearance by regulatory bodies, such as the FDA. Most DTx products on the market are mobile applications and/or wearable devices for various indications, including major depressive disorder, insomnia, and substance use disorder. With an increasing number of DTx products available, it’s essential to assess how these products may play a role in clinical therapy and evaluate their impact on key stakeholders.1

# Early Gustafson work on prediction and DTx
Greist and I developed a computer based interview that included a subjective Bayesian model to predict and (because it was designed by experts) explain whether and why the model believed a patient complaining of suicide thoughts would actually try to kill themselves.  It was quite successful and made Time Magazine at the time but never caught hold.I think it was one of the first predictions active analytics but we did not call it that.

The in the 80s the Kellogg foundation gave our team a grant to develop and test a computer based system (BARN) to help teenagers cope with alcohol, drugs, sex, and other teen age problems.   It had everything in it that CHESS has now except discussion groups cause there was no such thing as that at that time.  I am told that about 2100 middle and high schools eventually put it in their libraries.

Later we got other grants that added discussion groups to to BARN and focused on Breast Cancer and HIV. WE called that CHESS.

# Pitfalls and regulatory info/FDA
FDA - reSET in 2017
FDA relaxes regulation to encourage development during COVID


<!--FDA and evidence for reSET; https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-permits-marketing-mobile-medical-application-substance-use-disorder-->

reSET, the first Prescription Digital Therapeutic (PDT) to receive authorization from FDA to improve disease outcomes, is a 90-day PDT for Substance Use Disorder (SUD) intended to provide cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), as an adjunct to a contingency management system, for patients 18 years of age and older who are currently enrolled in outpatient treatment under the supervision of a clinician.
