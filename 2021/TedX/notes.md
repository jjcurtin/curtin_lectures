The next wave of patient care is upon us: digital therapeutics (DTx) – evidence-based, clinically evaluated software products that treat, manage, and prevent diseases.1 The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) estimated that 325,000 health care applications were available in 2017, resulting in approximately 3.7 billion mobile health application downloads over one year worldwide.2 With the global DTx market expected to grow between $6 and $9 billion by 2025, many major pharmaceutical companies have created in-house digital health teams or teamed up with digital health manufacturers to consider how DTx products can be integrated into disease management and provide an alternative form of therapeutic intervention for patients.2-5

A subset of digital health, DTx delivers therapeutic interventions directly to patients via different domains (e.g., virtual reality technologies, mobile applications, and artificial intelligence-powered assistants). Unlike digital health, DTx products require clinical evidence and clearance by regulatory bodies, such as the FDA. Most DTx products on the market are mobile applications and/or wearable devices for various indications, including major depressive disorder, insomnia, and substance use disorder. With an increasing number of DTx products available, it’s essential to assess how these products may play a role in clinical therapy and evaluate their impact on key stakeholders.1
