# Title

Mental healthcare at our fingertips


# Brief Abstract

Our mental healthcare system has serious flaws.  Treatments are expensive, access is limited, outcomes are modest at best, and large disparities exist by race, class, and geography.

Two technological innovations may fundamentally shift how we support people with mental illness.  Digital therapeutics can provide highly scalable, cost efficient treatment and other supports that are available 24/7 without geographic constraints.  Personal sensing allows digital therapeutics to deliver supports that are tailored to the specific needs of the person and the moment in time.  These innovations are just now possible given the ubiquity and computing power of today's smartphones.  

This talk explores the opportunities that these two innovations provide and the obstacles that must be overcome to reduce mental health disparities and improve outcomes for everyone. 

# Brief(er) Abstract
We are experiencing a mental health crisis in the U.S. with many millions of people not receiving the treatment they desperately need.  This talk explores how two emerging technological innovations, Digital Therapeutics and Personal Sensing, can address this crisis by delivering highly scalable treatment and other supports that can be precisely tailored to the specific needs of the person and their moment in time. 

# Bio

John Curtin, PhD, is a Professor of Psychology at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.  He is the Director of Clinical Training for the doctoral program in Clinical Psychology at UW-Madison and the Director of the Addiction Research Center.  

His program of research uses personal sensing and machine learning techniques for psychiatric diagnosis and risk prediction, precision medicine, and “just-in-time” interventions for substance use and other psychiatric disorders.  His scholarship has been recognized by grants from the National Institutes of Health and awards from the American Psychological Association, the Association for Psychological Science and UW-Madison.  Professor Curtin also contributes to UW-Madison's teaching mission, offering courses on substance use disorders, statistics, and applied machine learning.

## (Very) Draft Outline

1. The Current Mental Healthcare System
	* Mental health treatments and services havent evolved
    * Mental health outcomes are modest at best
    * Access is limited
    * Cost is high
    * Large disparities in access and outcomes by race, ethnicity, and class.

<!-- Slide:  Calendar of therapy appointments-->

2. Recent, rapid advances in two technological innovations promise disruptive change
    * ATM example of disruptive change
    * Fundamental shift in how we treat and support people with mental illness
    * Increase access
	* Decrease disparites
	* Improve outcomes

<!-- Slide: Bank teller vs. ATM.  and maybe vs. Venmo?? vs. Bitcoin??-->

3. Digital Therapeutics
    * Intervention and support apps delivered on smartphones
    * Available 24/7 without geographic constraints
    * Highly scalable and cost efficient
	* Examples of DTs
		* CBT4CBT
		* A-CHESS
		* reSET & reSET-O
	* Examples of interventions, tools and services
	* Preliminary evidence of efficacy

<!--Org Question: Where does smartphone come in?  As part of evolution of digital theraputics?  Need to have smartphone to increase access.  Need smartphone to be used by everyone to decrease access-->

<!-- Org Question: Where does clinician dashboard come in?  Just a service until digital theraputics meet personal sensing?-->

3. Personal Sensing
    * What is it
    * Example from grant
    * What can it do
	    * Predict
	    * Recommend treatments for people, for moment in time?
	    * Encourage adaptive changes to lifestyle
    * Preliminary evidence-

4.  Synergies between Digital Therapeutics and Personal Sensing

<!-- Org Question: Not sure how to organize these ideas yet but this section will highlight that: 1) Digital theraputics on smartphones make personal sensing feasible, given access to sensors, software and computing power, 2) Personal sensing makes digital theraputics smarter, allowing for its supports (treatments, tools & services) to be tailored to person, place, and time, 3) Personal sensing can also encourage greater engagement with both digital theraputics and traditional mental healhcare services, and  4) Digital theraputics can provide conduit for risk and symptom sensing back to health care providers to allow for efficiet resource allocation based on momentary need.  May need to focus or curtail these ideas-->

5. Obstacles and Recommendations
	* Privacy
	    * [Cambridge Analytica](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambridge_Analytica)  
	    * [Israeli Pegasus Spyware](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pegasus_(spyware))
	    * Who has access to the data and who benefits?  How are commercial apps supported?
	* Burden
		* Active vs. passive personal sensing
	* Disparities reified by Artificial Intelligence Algorithms (e.g., Weapons of Math Destruction)  <!-- Slide: Book cover image?-->
	* Shelf life <!-- Slide: Expired or rotting food on shelf or in frige?  ;-)-->
	* Integration into clinical care

<!-- Org Question: Won't do all of these.  Need to prioritize for interest and importance.-->
