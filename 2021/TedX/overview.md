1984 meets the 21st Century: Promise, Pitfalls and Prescriptions for Digital Mental Healthcare

# Brief Abstract

Our mental healthcare system is broken.  Treatments are expensive, access is limited, outcomes are modest at best, and large disparities exist by race and class.

Two technological innovations may fundamentally shift how we support people with mental illness.  Digital therapeutics can provide highly scalable, cost efficient treatment and other supports that are available 24/7 without geographic constraints.  Personal sensing allows digital therapeutics to deliver supports that are tailored to the specific needs of the person and the moment in time.

This talk explores the opportunities that these two technological innovations provide and the obstacles that must be overcome to reduce mental health disparities and improve outcomes for everyone. 


## Key Points

1. The Current Mental Healthcare System
	* Mental health treatments and services havent evolved
    * Mental health outcomes are modest at best
    * Access is limited
    * Cost is high
    * Large disparities in access and outcomes by race, ethnicity, and class.  

2. Recent, rapid advances in two digital innovations promise to:
	* Increase access
	* Decrease disparites
	* Improve outcomes

3. Digital Therapeutics
    * Intervention and support apps delivered on smartphones
    * Available 24/7 without geographic constraints
    * Highly scalable and cost efficient
	* Examples of DTs
		* CBT4CBT
		* A-CHESS
		* reSET
	* Examples of interventions, tools and services

<!--Where does smartphone come in?  As part of evolution of DTs?  Need to have smartphone to increase access.  Need smartphone to be used by everyone to decrease access-->

<!-- Where does clinician dashboard come in?  Just a service until DTs meet personal sensing?-->

3. Personal Sensing
    * What is it
    * Example from grant
    * What can we do
	    * Predict
	    * Recommend treatments
	    * Encorage adaptive lifestyle

4.  DTs meet personal sensing on a smartphone
	
5. Obstacles and Recommendations
	* Privacy
	* Burden
	* Disparities
	* Shelf life
