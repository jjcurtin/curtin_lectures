## The Mental Healthcare Crisis
<!--Image of my dad?  He is a real person!-->

My dad is a good man. But he has struggled with his use of alcohol for his entire adult life. It shaped our family.  He is almost 80 years old now and he has never received any treatment.  

After my mom experienced a permanently debilitating brain injury from a car accident, my dad devotedly stayed home for 25 years rather than work so that he could care for her at home.  However, this left him without health insurance through a job and therefore his **access** to mental healthcare was limited by its high cost.  

Even if he had had access to treatment, it likely wouldn’t have been **acceptable** to him. Like many men of his generation, asking for help from others and sharing personal problems wasn’t his strong suit. But even our family never discussed it.  It was the elephant in the room that we all ignored.

And had he received treatment, that treatment may not have been **available** to him at his moments of greatest need - when he lost his job due to downsizing, or shortly after my mom's car accident, or on the many dark mornings when he woke up with his hands shaking and had to decide if he was going to drink again to steady them. 

My dad suffered and he suffered without support from our mental healthcare system. In large part, my own work now is driven so that others don't suffer similarly.

<!--image of country with 52 million people?-->

We have a mental health crisis in the U.S., and it’s a crisis of **high need**.  

More than **one in five adults** suffer from some form of mental illness including substance use disorders. 

Mental illnesses overall are the leading cause of years of healthy life lost.

<!--image of city with population of 100,000;  Or a personal connection?-->
And in the past 12 months alone, almost **100,000 people** have died from drug overdoses.

---

But we don’t only have a crisis of high need, we have a crisis of **unmet** high need because our delivery of mental healthcare is deeply flawed.

In 2019, well over half of the individuals in the U.S. with an active mental illness did not receive any treatment.  **More than half**!  

And for those suffering with a substance use disorder in that same year, **9 out of 10 people** did not receive any treatment at all.  

---

Our failure to treat is even more troubling for vulnerable groups.  African American & Hispanic Americans receive mental healthcare services at about half the rate of whites.  

And similar mental healthcare disparities exist for people living in rural areas and for those with lower incomes.

---

**Access** , **acceptability**, and **availability** - these are the factors that undermine our mental healthcare system.  You can see them in my dad’s story, but you can see them in the stories of others as well.

---

/psychologist_heatmap.png
<!--edit figure title-->

My dad’s access to services was limited by their cost. But consider the **access** to mental health services for the farmer in rural Kansas, when more than 90% of all psychologists and psychiatrists and 80% of social workers work exclusively in metropolitan areas and predominately on the coasts.

<!--when 61% of rural counties lack a psychologist, 80% do not have even a single psychiatrist; and 91% lack a psychiatric NP.-->
---

/stigma_1.png
<!--consider this figure and buy-->

Seeking out mental health treatment is **unacceptable** to many of us because mental illness is still highly stigmatized and sharing our most intimate thoughts and feelings with a therapist is hard.  

---

/waitlist_2.jpg
<!--need to buy copyright or remake image-->

Mental healthcare services are often not **available** when we need them most.  For example, in Madison, WI, where I live, many well-regarded psychologists seem to rarely accept new patients, and others have wait lists that can delay a first visit for months.  

---

/calendar.png

And the delivery of mental healthcare still often involves weekly, monthly, or even less frequent appointments with a therapist.  But, of course, our mental health needs aren't limited this these sparse, pre-scheduled appointments.  Crises, stressors, strong drug cravings, and even drug relapses can occur and require support at any time.

## Digital Therapeutics

<!-- Consider image: Bank teller vs. ATM-->

Fortunately, we are now poised to experience disruptive innovation in the mental healthcare services that we provide and the methods by which they are delivered.

I use the term **disruptive innovation** intentionally to signal the magnitude and nature of this potentially transformative change.  
 
As a classic example of disruptive innovation, consider the ATMs impact on banking.  How many of you remember “bankers hours?” Today, ATMs can be found almost everywhere and they provide us with 24/7 access to our cash. 

In a similar fashion, digital therapeutics, and in particular, digital therapeutics **delivered on smartphones and made smarter still by personal sensing technologies**, are positioned to disrupt and improve mental healthcare.  They will make it more accessible, highly available, and for some, even more acceptable.  

---

So what are digital therapeutics?  

Digital therapeutics use software programs or "apps" to deliver evidence-based interventions to prevent, manage, or treat a medical disorder or disease. 
<!--They are used independently or in combination with medications or other therapies to optimize patient care and health outcomes.-->

---

/barn.png

The term, digital therapeutic, is new but this approach to providing healthcare is not.  In fact, much of the early work was pioneered here in Wisconsin, by my colleague David Gustafson, at the University of Wisconsin's Center for Health Enhancement Systems Studies.  

In the 1980s, Dave and his center released a computer-based system to help adolescents deal with substance use, health, and personal issues.  

But the impact of his and other early digital therapeutics remained limited because computers were expensive and many people didn't have access to them.

```

This all changed with the smartphone.  Raise your hand if you have a smartphone with you in your pocket or purse?  <!-- Maybe pull out my smartphone from my pocket?-->

85% of adults in the U.S. now own smartphones.  And ownership is already relatively high and increasing even for people from minority racial/ethnic groups, rural communities, and those with lower income.  Most of us now carry these pocket-sized, powerful, Internet-connected computers with us everywhere we go. Many of use even sleep with them next to our beds.

And its this widespread use of smartphones that has powered a surge in research, development, and implementation of the first wave of digital therapeutics for mental illness that can provide support to patients 24/7, wherever they go.

___

Some of the best examples of these digital therapeutics have been developed to support patients with alcohol and other substance use disorders.   Three separate, validated digital therapeutics are being used today by patients across the country during their treatment and recovery.  One of these digital therapeutics is the product of 30 years of continued research and development of the original system developed by Dave Gustafson at the University of Wisconsin that you just saw and the other two have been developed by digital health research centers at Yale and Dartmouth.

<!-- Need to improve the text in this panel.   Want to make clear there are rich/varied supports but need to make it more interesting!-->

<!-- Also  need an engaging image to make the transition-->

These digital therapeutics include a rich set of interventions, tools, and services to support patients.


They include:

* Specific interventions like cognitive behavioral therapy
* Interventions designed to increase well-being generally like guided meditation and guided stress reduction and relaxation modules
* Curated access to mental health relevant psycho-educational materials
* Peer support in the form of discussion forums and peer-to-peer messaging with the app.
* They can can also help locate self-help groups like AA and NA meetings.
* Healthcare planning tools such as medication managers, appointment scheduling, and appointment reminders are often included.  
* Self-assessment and symptom tracking tools are generally included
* Clinician dashboards are also emerging that can allow both bi-direction communication with healthcare providers and patient symptom tracking by clinicians

/woebot.png

<!-- Need to simplify the language here-->

On the more leading edge, there has been recent rapid developments of virtual relational agents that use natural language processing to communicate more naturally while providing support for mental illnesses.

For example, Woebot is a chatbot designed by Stanford-trained researchers and psychologists.  Woebot uses brief, text-based conversations and tools based on CBT and related interventions to provide psycho-education and guided support.  

---

By their very nature, all of these digital therapeutics on smartphones can be accessible and available, everywhere you go, 24/7.  But, equally important, many patients appear to find digital therapeutics acceptable.

For example, the VAs digital therapeutic for post-traumatic stress disorder, a single app in their suite of 20 digital therapeutics, has been downloaded more than a half million times across 115 countries.  And over 60% of its users engaged with it on multiple occasions. 

<!-- in the last week of March 2020 more than 750,000 Apple iOS users downloaded MBI apps (Kellen & Saxena, 2020)  https://aisel.aisnet.org/iceb2020/43/ -->

---

<!--Similar or modify a woebot?-->
/bot_bond.png

In fact, digital therapeutics may be more than just acceptable.  When chatbots or other virtual agents are included, patients may form real connections with them.  

In a recent study, over 36,000 adults who received digital cognitive behavioral therapy from Woebot described their therapeutic bond in terms typically reserved only for human therapists.  Patients frequently endorsed statements like:

* Woebot likes me.
* Woebot and I respect each other.
* Woebot appreciates me.
* Woebot cares about me even when I do things that they do not approve of.

---

Other studies has observed that patients self-disclose more, display their sadness more,  and do less impression management when interacting with virtual agents rather than human therapists.

<!--Alison Darcy, the developer of Woebot, has noted that this ability to establish a bond, and to do so with millions of people simultaneously, is the secret to unlocking the  vast potential of digital therapeutics-->

---

Of course, it would be meaningless if digital therapeutics were accessible, available, and acceptable if there were not effective tools to help people with substance use disorders and other mental illness.

And the available evidence today suggests they are effective.

For example, after being discharged from residential care, patients with alcohol use disorder using Dave Gustafson's digital therapeutic reported less than half as many risky drinking days and their odds of complete abstinence almost doubled relative to patients receiving traditional treatment only.

And these improvements were durable - they were maintained twelve months after leaving residential care.  

Similar results have been reported for alcohol and other drugs for the digital therapeutics developed by the Yale and Dartmouth centers as well.

---

<!--Image of single patient vs. millions of patients-->

The magnitude of these benefits are meaningful already, even when we only think about a single patient.  But their true power is in their scale, when these digital therapeutics are provided to millions in need they could substantially improve public health overall.

## Smarter Digital Therapeutics with Personal Sensing

<!-- Image representing challenge of choosing what to do-->

Much of potential of digital therapeutics arises from easy, 24/7 access to their rich and diverse set of interventions, tools, and services.

But this is also their challenge.  As the patient you now have to tackle difficult questions like:

* When should I use them?
* For how long?
* Which of their various supports are right for me?
* And which are right for me **now**, at this moment in time?

This is why the next wave of digital therapeutics must get smarter to realize their full potential.  And they will do this through the use of artificial intelligence powered personal sensing.

<!-- Not sure about the need to invoke AI.   The hook is to smarter digital therapuetics but maybe too obscure and unnecessary -->

---

<!--  Make this more plain english-->
"Personal sensing refers to collecting and analyzing data from sensors embedded in the context of daily life with the aim of identifying human behaviors, thoughts, feelings, and mental health symptoms".

---

<!-- "John, I'm still in your pocket and your watch and I have been noticing your heart rate.  We think I should lead you through some guided meditation to relax after you get off the stage...."-->

/smartphone.png

Much like digital therapeutics themselves, personal sensing has been supercharged by smartphones and the raw data that smartphones collect about us through their many sensors and logs

Smartphones log our personal communications by phone calls and text messages. Facebook posts, Instagram photos, tweets, and other social media activities are often created or viewed through our smartphones. Smartphone-embedded sensors know our moment-by-moment location and activity level.  Sensors can even detect other people, or at least their smartphones, in our immediate environment.  And much of this is done passively without any burden to us other then carrying and using our smartphones as we typically do.  

Personal sensing involves capturing all these raw data streams, deriving predictive features from these data, and submitting them to machine learning algorithms to characterize our recent experiences and behaviors, predict how we feel right now, and even predict how we may feel or behave in the future.  

---

My research team is one of a handful who have been funded by the National Institutes of Health to develop the foundation for personal sensing within digital therapeutics to help patients with substance use disorders.

We started this research when Dave Gustafson approached my team with a simple question. He asked...  

> "Could you predict not only who might be at greatest risk for relapse
> but critically, precisely WHEN that relapse might occur."  

If done well, this would open up a world of possibilities within digital therapeutics for substance use disorders.  

Not least among these is the possibility to deliver interventions "just-in-time", in other words, both at the moments of greatest need and when these interventions are predicted to be most effective.  

---

/gps_1.png

And I can help you develop a solid intuition for how this works by looking a bit more closely at two of the more revealing personal sensing methods we are developing.  

First, sensing people's moment by moment location using their smartphone can provide a clear window into their daily lives, their day-to-day activities, and their overall health, both physical and mental.  

Behind me is a wide view of my movement patterns detected by my smartphone over a two-month period when we were first developing this personal sensing method.  You can see the paths that I traveled, with travel by car in yellow and running in blue.  The points in red indicate places that I stopped to visit for at least a few minutes.  And although not displayed here, we know the day and exact time that I was at each location.  

You can immediately see that I am runner, with long runs leaving from downtown Madison and frequent trail runs in the county and state parts to the west and northwest.  Running makes an important contribution to both my physical and mental health. You could learn these patterns and also detect if events in my life disrupted these patterns.

---

/gps_2.png

Zooming in to the Madison isthmus, you can immediately see dense clusters of red dots indicating places visited near my home and where I work at the University of Wisconsin.  You can see that I drive my children clockwise around the lake each morning to their elementary school.  And you could detect those stressful mornings when getting my young kids dressed and fed didn't go as planned and we were late, sometimes very late, to school!

You can see my daily running commute to and from my office.  From this, you can observe the long days, and short days, at the office.   

If you probed the red dots indicating the places I visit, you would find the restaurants, bars, and coffee shops I frequent to eat, drink and socialize.  You could identify the homes of my friends, and the stores where I shop.  You could see when my life was filled with healthy and rewarding social activities.  You might also see periods of social isolation during bouts with depression or high stress.



<!--Can still tune these examples above-->
<!-- time in hospital-->   <!--time away from work and running-->  <!--COVID image?-->

---

/text_messages.png
<!--Will edit for copyright and to more clearly convey stressor of having phone stolen-->

We also collect smartphone communications logs and text message content.  And no, I don't plan to show you my actual text messages!

But imagine what you could learn about me if you knew the patterns of my communications - Who I was calling, when I made those calls, and even the content of what I sent and received by text message, in other words, my own words.  You might see the late sleepless nights, particularly if you also logged all the use of my smartphone.  You might see my messages sharing joys or stressors, like when my expensive phone was stolen.  Natural language processing could be used to extract the meaning of my words and use this to make inferences about my recent experiences, emotional state, and even psychiatric symptoms. 

---

These raw location and communications data that we sense directly from the smartphone are powerful signals for prediction right out of the box. But personal sensing draws additional power from repeated measurements of the same person over days, weeks, months, and even years.  It is the change in our patterns that are often most meaningful.  We stop going to work briefly for a vacation or we stop for a longer period when we lose our job. We stop or restart going to AA meetings or to our therapist.  

Or we start late night calls and text messages after a period of successful recovery when we had established more healthy behaviors and lifestyle. 

<!--consider better examples-->

---

<!--Slide: Text message with "Mom" vs. "Joe Party-Party".-->

/mom_raw.png

We can engineer even more sensitive predictive features from these data by discovering what these people and places mean to us.

For example, this very same text message thread behind me may indicate quite different risk for relapse when sent to your mother, who supports your recovery, vs. a friend who still regularly engages in drug use themselves <!-- or "...who wants you back at their parties" if that seems more acceptable info to gather without unpacking-->.  

We can gather this information quickly and with little burden to the patient by pushing out a few key questions to their smartphone about their frequent contacts and locations over the first couple of months of their use of the digital therapeutic. It turns out that we are all creatures of habit, and we only have a small number of important people and places in our lives.

We can identify the specific people and places that make us happy or sad or stressed, those that we perceive support our recovery or undermine it. Armed with this information, we can gain more precise insights into your patterns of movements and social communications. Are they healthy or unhealthy, rewarding and rich, or stressful or isolating.  And how have these patterns changed, for better or for worse, over recent days, weeks, and months.  

<!--need pronouns and consistent focus on target we are sensing-->
---

<!-- Maybe a map with clear indications of my house, my office, and a few key public bars and health care facilities??  -->

We can further flesh out the meaning for specific places passively using their spacial-temporal features and publicly available map data that are often sufficient to identify our home, our workplace, and commercial spaces, like bars, restaurants, liquor stores, healthcare facilities and the like.  

---

Our preliminary analyses have already demonstrated that we can use predictive features derived from this enriched personal sensing to determine the probability of a future lapse within the next 24 hours with high accuracy.  We are now working actively to increase the temporal precision of these predictions from the day to the exact hour when the lapse starts and from tomorrow to next week.

If patients knew their future risk, they could plan accordingly.  They could increase their use of their digital therapeutic or step up their traditional mental healthcare when their risk of relapse was high or increasing.  

Patients could also opt in to share their risk with their healthcare providers though their digital therapuetic's clinician dashboard.  This would allow clinicians to efficiently direct their own limited resources toward their patients with greatest need.

---

Once we can predict relapse risk using personal sensing, we can also begin to ask an even more important question.

> What interventions or other supports are optimal for a specific
> patient at a specific moment in time to reduce their risk?

For example, if recent poor sleep is contributing to their risk, interventions to improve sleep hygiene or reduce stress could be delivered.  

If they have slipped back into interactions with unhealthy peers, they could be encouraged to re-engage with peer support groups within the digital therapeutic or provided with information about upcoming local AA or NA meetings.  

During moments of peak craving, they could be distracted by engaging video games until their craving subsides as it usually does.  Immediate contact with designated supportive family or sponsors could also recommended and facilitated.

With digital therapeutics and personal sensing, we can start to imagine what precision mental healthcare might look like — “delivering the right treatments, at the right time, to the right person, every time”


## Pitfalls and Prescriptions

These goals are possible, if not today, in the coming years as we continue to develop smart digital therapeutics. However, there are no guarantees and numerous pitfalls exist that we must avoid. 

To my eye, the greatest obstacles emerge from tensions among three related issues:

 1. How we regulate digital therapeutics to assure their safety and effectiveness, 
 2. How we distribute them to patients
 3. And who pays for them

---

<!-- Wild west image -->
Currently, the world of digital health more broadly is a bit like the Wild West.  There are over 350k digital health apps available for download in app stores on our smartphones. Many of these apps have little or no evidence of their effectiveness.  And privacy risks become paramount as more and more apps incorporate personal sensing of our sensitive data.

Fortunately, the FDA has begun to recognize the need for regulation and to clarify its planned approach.  The FDA does not plan to regulate the broad category of digital health apps that are intended to maintain or encourage a healthy
lifestyle.  However, they do plan to provide regulatory oversight for the narrower class of digital therapeutics that are used to diagnose, treat or manage disease including mental illness.  In fact, in 2018 the FDA cleared the first digital therapeutic for substance use disorders based in part on evidence of its effectiveness.  

This is an important first step but FDA oversight is not sufficient because patients may not always be aware of their guidance or the subtle distinctions between a digital health app and a digital therapeutic.

---

Mental healthcare providers may serve as an important and trustworthy conduit of safe and effective digital therapeutics to their patients. However, if digital therapeutics are only available through healthcare providers we may miss the opportunity to address mental health disparities among vulnerable groups who are uninsured or don't otherwise have access to healthcare.

---

The VA offers an interesting model where they provide their own digital therapeutics directly through the VA website, but free to everyone.  This allows them to recommend and broadly distribute digital therapeutics that are safe and effective.  

However, as smart digital therapeutics become more expensive to develop, evaluate, and maintain, it is not clear who will pay these expenses if they are freely distributed.  

Some of the most promising digital therapeutics for substance use disorders have resulted from academic/commercial partnerships but these therapeutics are not free.  

---

We also need to tackle issues that arise from scale.  Digital therapeutics are highly scalable given that many of their supports are not dependent on human clinicians but software.  This scale can address key issues with access and availability that are serious problems for traditional mental healthcare with human clinicians.  Their scale can also control mental healthcare costs.  

Unfortunately, scale comes with risks as well. As digital therapeutics scale, there may economic pressures to limit access to or even replace human clinicians.  We must resist this impulse that could compromise outcomes in favor of lower costs.

The scale of digital therapeutics may also further homogenize mental healthcare by providing the same interventions to all patients.  To be clear, this is already a problem for traditional mental healthcare interventions which have primarily been developed and evaluated with white patients.  However, to the degree that there is recognition of this problem and some diversity across human clinicians, their interventions are tailored at times to be culturally appropriate for communities of color and other minority groups.  We have an opportunity to intentionally recruit clinicians of color to re-imagine these new and modified interventions that are delivered by digital therapeutics so that they are acceptable for everyone. 

---

The use of personal sensing in smart digital therapeutics may help us tailor the support they provide. Personal sensing AI algorithms can recommend and deliver the optimal supports based on characteristics of the patient, their environment, and their recent experiences.  However, these algorithms must be trained on diverse samples of patients - black and brown patients, patients from rural communities. If we fail to do this, the algorithms' recommendations will be biased toward the needs of the majority and we may exacerbate rather than reduce existing health disparities. 

<!-- consider issue of shelf life and need for ongoing evaluation -->

But if we succeed, smart digital therapeutics will become important tools to reduce our mental health crisis broadly while also addressing intolerable disparities in health outcomes.   

<!--Need more powerful end!-->
