# Mental Healthcare at Your Fingertips


## The Mental Healthcare Crisis
<!--Image of my dad?-->

When I was still relatively young, my mother lost control of her car when it hit a patch of ice two days before Christmas.  Her car spun off the road, her seat collapsed, and she experienced a traumatic brain injury.  She survived but she never recovered.  She required full-time care for the rest of her life.  My dad devotedly stayed home for 25 years rather than work so that he could care for her at home rather than commit her to an institution. My dad is a good man.      

My dad is a good man who he has struggled with his use of alcohol for his entire adult life. At times, it was in the background of our lives.  At other times, it was severe and almost impossible to ignore. But we did. He is almost 80 years old now and he has never received any treatment.  It breaks my heart, but it is not surprising.

While caring for my mom at home, his **access** to mental healthcare was limited by its high cost without health insurance through a job.  

Even if he had had access to treatment, it likely wouldn’t have been **acceptable** to him. Like many men of his generation, asking for help from others and sharing personal problems wasn’t his strong suit. But **even our family** never discussed it.  It was the elephant in the room.

And had he received treatment, that treatment may not have been **available** to him at his moments of greatest need - when he lost a job due to downsizing, or shortly after my mom's car accident, or on the many dark mornings when he woke up with his hands shaking and had to decide if he was going to drink again to steady them. 

My dad is a good man, and he suffered.  He suffered without support from our mental healthcare system. In large part, my work now is driven so that others don't suffer similarly.

<!--image of country with 52 million people?-->

We have a mental health crisis in the U.S., and it’s a crisis of **high need**.  

More than **one in five adults** suffer from some form of mental illness including substance use disorders. 

---


And in the past 12 months alone, almost **100,000 people** have died from drug overdoses.  One of them was the brother of my graduate student, who died from an opioid overdose this past spring.

<!--"my graduate student"-->

---

We have a mental health crisis, and more precisely, it is a crisis of **unmet** high need because our delivery of mental healthcare is deeply flawed.

In 2019, well over half of the individuals in the U.S. with an active mental illness did not receive **any** treatment.  **More than half**!  

And for those suffering with a substance use disorder in that same year, **9 out of 10 people** did not receive any treatment at all.  

---

Our failure to treat is even more troubling for vulnerable groups.  African American & Hispanic Americans receive mental healthcare services at about half the rate of whites.  

And similar mental healthcare disparities exist for people living in rural areas and for those with lower incomes.

---

**Access** , **acceptability**, and **availability** - these are the factors that undermine our mental healthcare system.  You can see them in my dad’s story, but you can see them in the stories of so many of our family, friends, and even ourselves.

---

<!--edit figure title-->

My dad’s access to services was limited by their cost. But consider the **access** to mental healthcare for the farmer in rural Kansas, when more than 90% of all psychologists and psychiatrists and 80% of social workers work exclusively in metropolitan areas and predominately on the coasts.

---

/stigma_1.png
<!--consider this figure and buy-->

Seeking out mental health treatment is **unacceptable** to many of us because mental illness is still highly stigmatized and making ourselves vulnerable by sharing our most intimate thoughts and feelings with a therapist is hard.  

<!--GEF: consider incorporating what we talked about, how difficult it was for you to be willing to share your dad's story, and you study this. -->

/waitlist_2.jpg
/calendar.png
<!--combine images and maybe panel and order by point-->

Mental healthcare services are often not **available** when we need them most.  Many well-regarded psychologists have long wait lists that can delay the start of treatment for months.  

And once we make it off the wait list, treatment still often involves weekly, monthly, or even less frequent appointments with a therapist.  But our mental health needs aren't limited to these sparse, pre-scheduled appointments.  Crises, stressors, strong drug cravings and other difficult thoughts and emotions can occur and require support at any time.

## Digital Therapeutics

Access, acceptability, and availability - these issues are undermining our mental healthcare system and leaving millions without treatment when they need it most.  

Fortunately, I am here today to tell you that digital therapeutics, and in particular, digital therapeutics **delivered on smartphones and made smarter still by personal sensing technologies**, are now emerging to target these very same three issues.  

___

But let me pause for a moment.  I want to be very clear on one point before we move forward.  I do not believe or even hope that digital therapeutics will replace human clinicians. 

* Digital therapeutics offer us **new tools** that are not part of traditional mental healthcare delivered by human clinicians
* Digital therapeutics can provide a safety net for people who are not receiving traditional care now. 
* Digital therapeutics may reduce barriers for some people that later eases them into traditional care.  
* And digital therapeutics can optimize traditional care to extend its reach and impact while allowing clinicians the time to provide what they do uniquely well. 

Human clinicians will always be needed but we simply need more than they can provide alone.  Digital therapeutics can provide that "more."

So what are digital therapeutics?

Digital therapeutics are software programs or "apps" that are designed to prevent, manage, or treat a medical disorder. 

<!--consider distinguishing them from broader category of digital health apps?-->

---

/barn.png
<!--Still use image but with caption to indicate early CHESS?-->

Digital therapeutics **delivered on computers** have been around since the 1980s but their impact remained limited because computers were expensive and many people didn't have access to them.

This all changed with the smartphone.  Raise your hand if you have a smartphone with you in your pocket or purse?  

<!-- Pull out my smartphone from my pocket and hold it up-->

<!--plot of ownership combined with simple tables?-->

/smartphone_ownership.png

```
Smartphone Ownership by Key Demographics

Overall	                85%

Black	                83%
Hispanic	            85%
Rural	                80%
Income < $30,000/year	76%
```

Today, 85% of adults in the U.S. own smartphones.  And ownership is already relatively high and increasing even for people from vulnerable groups including minority racial/ethnic groups, rural communities, and those with lower income.  

Most of us now carry these pocket-sized, powerful, Internet-connected computers with us everywhere we go.

And its this widespread use of smartphones that has powered a surge in research, development, and implementation of the first wave of digital therapeutics that can now provide us support
* 24 hours a day, 
* 7 days a week, 
* every day of the year,
* regardless of where we live, 
* and wherever we go

<!-- Need an engaging image to make the transition and highlight diversity of tools and services.   Cartoon/sketch?-->

<!-- Need to improve the text in this panel.   Want to make clear there are rich/varied supports but need to make it more interesting!-->

Some of the best examples of these digital therapeutics have been developed to support patients with alcohol and other substance use disorders.  They include a rich set of interventions, tools, and services to support patients during their recovery.

These include:

* Evidence-based interventions like cognitive behavioral therapy
* Interventions designed to increase well-being or reduce stress like guided meditation
* Curated psycho-educational materials about substance use and mental health
* Peer support in the form of discussion forums with other patients using the app
* Search tools to locate self-help groups like AA and NA meetings
* Healthcare planning tools such as medication managers, appointment scheduling, and appointment reminders
* And self-assessment and symptom tracking tools

Clinician dashboards are also being developed to allow communication with healthcare providers.  These dashboards can also allow clinicians to track their patients' symptoms in real time. 

---

And on the leading edge, some digital therapeutics now use virtual agents that can text message or even talk to patients in a more natural way while they provide support.  

<!--And the emerging evidence suggests that patients can develop bonds with these virtual agents that can approach what we see with human therapists.-->

---

<!-- break apart with simple, single stats images?-->
<!-- ~2x the odds of remaining abstinent-->
<!-- Benefits are long lasting-->
<!-- May increase retention in traditional treatment-->
Of course, all of this would be meaningless if digital therapeutics were not effective.

But they are.  

For example, patients using digital therapeutics have about double the odds of remaining abstinent from alcohol or other drugs.

These increases in abstinence from using digital therapeutics are observed when compared to patients on wait lists, who have yet to gained access to treatment.  

But these increases in abstinence are also observed when digital therapeutics are added on top of traditional treatments for substance use disorders.

And these benefits are durable - they have been documented up to 12 months after the start of treatment.  

Furthermore, emerging evidence suggests that the use of digital therapeutics can also increase retention in traditional treatments for substance use disorders.  This highlights again that digital therapeutics can complement rather than compete with care offered by human clinicians.  

---

<!--Image of single patient on couch with therapist or a single person using smartphone vs. crowd of people with smartphones-->

This is a big deal.  The magnitude of these benefits are meaningful already, even when we only think about a single patient.  

---

/smartphone_crowd.png

But their true power is in their scale, when the benefits from these apps are multiplied because they are provided simultaneously to millions of people in need.  

This is how we can increase the treatment capacity of our mental healthcare system.

This is how we will see substantial improvement in public mental health overall.

## Smarter Digital Therapeutics with Personal Sensing

/beta.png

OK, so lets call the smartphone apps I have described to you so far, the beta version of digital therapeutics.  These apps are available and in use today by small numbers of people with substance use disorders across the country.

Their power arises from easy, 24/7 access to their rich and diverse set of supports -their interventions, tools, and services.

---

<!-- Image representing challenge of choosing what to do-->

But this is also their Achilles heel.  As the patient using these apps, you now have to tackle difficult questions like:

* When should I use them?
* For how long?
* Which of their various supports are right for me?
* And which are right for me **now**, at this moment in time?

---

This is why the next wave of digital therapeutics must get smarter to realize their full potential.  They must get smarter and they must learn to know us better as individuals, not just a homogeneous group of patients with the same coarse diagnoses and same treatment needs at all times.  

And they will do this through the use of built-in artificial intelligence algorithms that are powered by personal sensing.

---

Although you may not have heard the term "personal sensing" before, you have almost certainly seen it in action.

I'm a running nut, and for me, ads for trail running shoes, the latest running backpacks, or the newest fancy water bottles follow me around everywhere.  And they work.  My closet is overflowing with all the latest brands of now stinky trail runners.   
 
This fall, I've been bombarded with ads for books, videos, and classes to improve my public speaking.   Right about now, I am kinda wishing I bought a few.

<!--On a slightly more embarrassing note, after having a vasectomy a few years ago, I immediately started receiving ads for ice packs and "tighty-whitey" supportive underwear.   But those worked too! -->

<!--Other or better examples?......-->

---

/smartphone.png

Much like digital therapeutics themselves, personal sensing has been supercharged by smartphones and the data that they collect about us through their many sensors and logs

<!-- simplify this and synch with an image by Kortney-->

Smartphones log our personal communications by phone calls and text messages. Facebook posts and other social media activities are often created or viewed through our smartphones. Smartphone-embedded sensors know our moment-by-moment location and activity level.  Sensors can even detect other people, or at least their smartphones, in our immediate environment.  And much of this is done passively without any burden to us other then carrying and using our smartphones as we typically do.  

Personal sensing involves capturing all this information and using it to understand our recent experiences, preferences, and behaviors.  It can be used to predict how we feel right now, and even how we may feel or behave in the future.  

---

My research team became interested in personal sensing when Dave Gustafson, the developer of a leading digital therapeutic for substance use disorders, approached us with a simple question. He asked...  

> "Could you predict not only who might be at greatest risk for relapse
> but **precisely when** that relapse might occur and 
> **how best to intervene** to prevent it"  

He had just completed another large study of his app that again confirmed about double the odds of abstinence among its users.  However, he also noticed among those people who did still relapse, many of them either hadn't used the app in the days leading up that relapse or if they did use it, they hadn't used the specific supports in the app that he would have thought would be most effective.

He wondered if the benefits of his app could be increased further if it knew the person well enough to recognize when they were at greatest risk for relapse and if it was smart enough to recommend the specific supports that would be most effective for them at that moment in time.  

This launched us on a new program of research to develop personal sensing algorithms  that could accomplish these goals.

<!-- "John, er... excuse me....sorry to interupt but I'm still in your pocket and your apple watch and I have been noticing your high heart rate.  We think I should lead you through some guided meditation to relax after you get off the stage.  And dont forget to take a trail run in the Kettles on your drive back to Madison. "-->

Let's "look under the hood" so to speak at two of the more revealing personal sensing methods that we are developing to give you an intuition about how this works.

Behind me is a wide view of my moment by moment location detected by my smartphone over a month when we were first experimenting with this personal sensing method.  You can see the paths that I traveled, with movement by car in yellow and running in blue.  

The points in red indicate places that I stopped to visit for at least a few minutes.  And although not displayed here, we know the days and exact times that I was at each location.  

As my smartphone ads already know, you can immediately see that I am runner, with long runs leaving from downtown Madison and frequent trail runs in the county and state parks to the west and northwest.  Running is key to both my physical and mental health.

---

/gps_2.png

Zooming in to the Madison isthmus, you can see dense clusters of red dots indicating places visited near my home and where I work at the University of Wisconsin.  You can see that I drive my children clockwise around the lake each morning to their elementary school.  And you could detect those stressful mornings when getting my young kids dressed and fed didn't go as planned and we were late, sometimes very late, to school!

You can see my daily running commute to and from my office.  From this, you can observe the long days, and short days, at the office.   

If you probed the red dots indicating the places I visit, you would find the restaurants, bars, and coffee shops where I eat, drink and socialize.  We can use public map data to identify these places and make inferences about what I do there.  

<!--Can still tune these examples above-->
<!-- time in hospital-->   <!--time away from work and running-->  <!--COVID image?-->
<!--specific restaurants or cafes if humorous or personalizing-->

/text_messages.png

<!--Will edit for copyright-->

We also collect smartphone communications logs and even the content of text messages.  And no such luck, I don't plan to show you my actual text messages!

But imagine what you could learn about me if you knew the patterns of my communications - Who I was calling, when I made those calls, and even the content of what I sent and received by text message, in other words, my own words.  

---

/mom_raw.png

<!-- make this image funny with faces??-->

We can make these raw location and communications data more powerful still by discovering what these people and places actually mean to us.  

For example, this very same text message thread behind me would indicate quite different risk for relapse for someone in recovery when sent to their mother, who supports their recovery, vs. their drinking buddy who wants them back in the bar. 

---

We can gather this information quickly by pushing out a few key questions to their smartphone about their frequent contacts and locations over the first couple of months of their use of the app. It turns out that we are all creatures of habit, and typically only have a small number of important people and places in our lives.

We can identify the specific people and places that make us happy or sad or stressed, those that we perceive support our recovery and those who undermine it. Armed with this information, our algorithms can make even more precise predictions.

For my dad, we could learn that his friend Ed has been a lifelong source of stability and support.  We would know my dad is doing well when he spends time at Ed's house, when they call and text each other to plan activities, when they go for daily walks along the beach by the Long Island Sound.  

We could also see when time spent with Ed abruptly stops each fall because Ed spends his winters in Florida.  These months are harder for my dad and he would benefit from more support.

He could be encouraged by the app to reach out to other supportive family and friends during these times.  He could be provided with locations and meeting times for support groups in his community.  He could even be assisted to build community in the discussion forums within the app itself.

If the app knew him well, it could predict which of these forms of support might be most effective for him.

If he had also received traditional mental healthcare, he might have given permission for the app share his risk with his therapist.  This could allow clinicians to efficiently direct their own limited resources toward their patients with greatest need.

<!--We could pinpoint the day of my mom's car accident, when my dad is suddenly spending all day, into the late evening, at St John's Hospital, and returning home for only a few hours of sleep each night.  If this happened now, there would also be frantic text messages to keep family and friends informed-->

---

<!--Any benefit to using me too?-->
<!--If we were sensing my life about a year ago, we would see my 8 days as an inpatient at UW Hospital following a rare and life-threatening drug reaction to an antibiotic I had received.  We would see my frantic text messages to keep family and friends informed.  After I was discharged, we would notice my sleepless nights caused in part by high doses of corticosteroids.  The app might know that I had started dabbling with meditation and it could recommend I medidate at night to help me sleep better.  Continue with running stopped, depression, nudge me to start again-->

In our research studies, we can already predict if someone will drink tomorrow with relatively high accuracy based on personal sensing of their recent experiences and behavior.  

But these are research studies.  And we started with participants from our local Madison community.  And the samples were predominately white. Personal sensing algorithms trained on these participants would be unlikely to work well with patients from rural communities or black and brown patients.  

We have seen these failures for A 



Personal sensing AI algorithms can recommend and deliver the optimal supports based on characteristics of the patient, their environment, and their recent experiences.  However, these algorithms must be trained on diverse samples of patients - black and brown patients, patients from rural communities. If we fail to do this, the algorithms' recommendations will be biased toward the needs of the majority and we may exacerbate rather than reduce existing health disparities. 

<!-- facial analysis software couldn’t detect my dark-skinned face until I put on a white mask. These systems are often trained on images of predominantly light-skinned men. Given the task of guessing the gender of a face, all companies performed substantially better on male faces than female faces. The companies I evaluated had error rates of no more than 1% for lighter-skinned men. For darker-skinned women, the errors soared to 35%. AI systems from leading companies have failed to correctly classify the faces of Oprah Winfrey, Michelle Obama, and Serena Williams.-->

At some point, probably about five minutes ago, you probably thought "Holy crap, this is really private information, who will have it and what will they do with it?"

<!-- make this quote a slide?-->
With digital therapeutics and personal sensing, we can start to imagine what precision mental healthcare might look like — “delivering the right treatments, at the right time, to the right person, every time”

These tools weren't available to support my dad.  BUT.....
<!--Too late for my dad.  I hope we can do better for my son and daughter if they need support in the future.  Images?-->

<!--One more sentence to tie back as addressing the mental health crisis-->

<!--GEF: These advances would allow us to tackle the issues of access, acceptability, and availability currently plaguing mental healthcare. Armed with digital therapeutics and personal sensing, we can get help to the untreated individuals who need support and care, when and where they need it most.-->
