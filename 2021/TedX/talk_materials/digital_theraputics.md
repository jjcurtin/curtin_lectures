# Mental Healthcare at our Fingertips


## The Mental Healthcare Crisis

When I was still relatively young, my mother lost control of her car when it hit a patch of ice two days before Christmas.  Her car spun off the road, her seat collapsed, and she experienced a traumatic brain injury.  She survived but she never recovered even to the point of recognizing my sister and me.  She required full-time care for the rest of her life and it devastated my family.

/dad.jpg

My dad is a good man.  He devotedly stayed home for 25 years rather than work so that he could care for my mom at home rather than commit her to an institution.     

My dad is a good man who he has struggled with his use of alcohol for his entire adult life. At times, it was in the background of our lives.  At other times, it was severe and almost impossible to ignore. But we did. He is almost 80 years old now and he has never received any treatment.  It breaks my heart, but it is not surprising.

---

We have a mental health crisis in the U.S. and it is a crisis of **unmet** high need because our delivery of mental healthcare is deeply flawed.

In 2019, well over half of the 52 million individuals in the U.S. with an active mental illness did not receive **any** treatment.  **More than half**!  

And for those suffering with a substance use disorder - like my dad - it was worse still.  **9 out of 10 people** with substance use disorders did not receive any treatment at all.

Our failure to provide treatment has tragic consequences.  In the past 12 months alone, almost **100,000 people** have died from drug overdoses.

And these are not just big numbers, they are real people.

One of them was Victor Kittleson, the 29 year old brother of my graduate student, who died from an opioid overdose this past summer.

---

Our failure to treat is even more troubling for vulnerable groups.  African American & Hispanic Americans receive mental healthcare services at about half the rate of whites.  

And similar mental healthcare disparities exist for people living in rural areas and for those with lower incomes.

---

**Access** , **acceptability**, and **availability** - these are the factors that undermine our mental healthcare system.  

---

While caring for my mom at home, my dad's **access** to mental healthcare was limited by its high cost without health insurance through a job.  

---

/psychologist_heatmap.png
<!--Have Kortney edit colors in figure to be standard heat map with clearer legend and title-->

But geography also impacts access.  For example, consider the **access** to mental healthcare for the farmer in rural Kansas, when more than 90% of all psychologists and psychiatrists and 80% of social workers work exclusively in metropolitan areas and predominately on the coasts.  

---

<!--consider stock images and talk with Kortney too about her ideas-->

Even if my dad had had access to treatment, it likely wouldn’t have been **acceptable** to him. Like many men of his generation, asking for help from others and sharing personal problems wasn’t his strong suit. 

But **even our family** never discussed it.  It was the elephant in the room.  Making ourselves vulnerable to therapists and to each other is hard.  

And it is harder still because of the stigma that still surrounds mental illness even today.

---

/waitlist_2.jpg

Mental healthcare services are often not **available** when we need them most.  Many well-regarded psychologists have long wait lists that can delay the start of treatment for months.  

And once we make it off the wait list, treatment still often involves weekly, monthly, or even less frequent appointments with a therapist.  But our mental health needs aren't limited to these pre-scheduled appointments.  

Would a therapist have been available to my dad at his moments of greatest need - when he lost a job due to downsizing, or shortly after my mom's car accident, or on the many dark mornings when he woke up with his hands shaking and had to decide if he was going to drink again to steady them? 

## Digital Therapeutics

**Access, acceptability, and availability** - these issues are undermining the treatment capacity of our mental healthcare system and leaving millions without treatment when they need it most.  

Fortunately, digital therapeutics, and in particular, digital therapeutics **delivered on smartphones and made smarter still by personal sensing technologies**, are now emerging to target these very same three issues.  

___

But let me pause for a moment.  I want to be very clear on one point before we move forward.  I do not believe or hope that digital therapeutics will replace human therapists. 
  
Therapists will always be needed for what they do uniquely well.  But we simply need more than they can provide alone.  Digital therapeutics can provide that "more."

---

So what are digital therapeutics?

Digital therapeutics are software programs or "apps" that are designed to prevent, manage, or treat a medical disorder. 
 
<!--GEF: Digital therapeutics are a subset of health-related software programs or "apps". They're not just counting your steps - they are explicitly designed to prevent, manage, or treat a medical disorder.-->

---

<!--use stock images of lots of diverse people using phones in diverse locations-->

Digital therapeutics are delivered to patients on their smartphones and this is the key to their accessibility and availability.

Today, 85% of adults in the U.S. own smartphones.  And equally important, ownership is similarly high regardless of race, ethnicity, income, and geography.

Most of us now carry these pocket-sized, powerful computers with us everywhere we go.

And its this widespread use of smartphones that allows digital therapeutics to provide support
* 24 hours a day, 
* 7 days a week, 
* every day of the year,
* regardless of where we live

<!--GEF: transition to personal examples/add in personal context instead. E.g., "If my dad had access to a digital therapeutic, he could have used it to..." -->

Some of the best examples of these digital therapeutics have been developed to support patients with substance use disorders.  They include a rich set of interventions, tools, and services to support patients during their recovery.

Examples of these include:

* Evidence-based interventions like cognitive behavioral therapy and mindfulness based stress reduction.  
* Peer support in discussion forums with other patients using the app
* Search tools to locate self-help groups like AA and NA meetings
* Healthcare planning tools such as medication managers and appointment reminders
* And self-assessment and symptom tracking tools

Clinician dashboards are also being developed to allow communication with healthcare providers within the app.

And some digital therapeutics now use chatbots or other virtual agents that can text message or even talk to patients in a more natural way while they provide support.  

---

Of course, all of this would be meaningless if digital therapeutics were not effective.

But they are.  

For example, patients using digital therapeutics are almost twice as likely to be abstinent from alcohol or other drugs.

These increases in abstinence from using digital therapeutics are observed not only when compared to patients on wait lists, who have yet to gained access to treatment but also when digital therapeutics are added on top of traditional treatments for substance use disorders.

And these benefits are durable - they have been documented up to 12 months after the start of treatment.  

---

/single_patient.png

This is a big deal.  The magnitude of these benefits are meaningful already, even when we only think about a single patient.  

---

/smartphone_crowd.png

<!--This is not a stock image.   I really like it if we can find a way to buy rights to it.  If  not, we need something similar.-->

But their true power is in their scale, when the benefits from these apps are multiplied because they are provided simultaneously to millions of people in need.  

This is how we can increase the treatment capacity of our mental healthcare system and see substantial improvement in public mental health overall.  
 
## Smarter Digital Therapeutics with Personal Sensing

/beta.png

OK, so lets call the apps I have described to you so far, the beta version of digital therapeutics.  Their power arises from easy, 24/7 access to their rich and diverse set of supports - their interventions, tools, and services.

---

<!-- Image representing challenge of choosing what to do?  Talk with Kortney about her ideas-->

But this is also their Achilles heel.  As the patient using these apps, you now have to tackle difficult questions like:
 
* When should I use them?
* For how long?
* Which of their various supports are right for me?
* And which are right for me **now**, at this moment in time?

---

To realize their full potential, the next wave of digital therapeutics must learn to know us better as individuals, not just patients with the same coarse diagnoses and same treatment needs at all times.  

And they will do this through the use of built-in artificial intelligence algorithms that are powered by personal sensing.

---

Although you may not have heard the term "personal sensing" before, you have almost certainly seen it in action.

I'm a running nut, and for me, ads for trail running shoes, the latest running backpacks, or the newest fancy water bottles follow me around everywhere.  
 
This fall, I've been bombarded with ads for books, videos, and classes to improve my public speaking.   Right about now, I am kinda wishing I bought a few.

/smartphone.png
<!-- Have Kortney create a similar image.  We dont have copyright to this one.  Just grabbed it off the web-->
<!-- simplify this text and synch with image created by Kortney-->

Personal sensing has been supercharged by smartphones and the data that they collect about us through their many sensors and logs

Smartphones log our personal communications by phone calls and text messages. Facebook posts and other social media activities are often created or viewed through our smartphones. Smartphone-embedded sensors know our moment-by-moment location and activity level.  Sensors can even detect other people, or at least their smartphones, in our immediate environment.  And much of this is done passively without any burden to us other then carrying and using our smartphones as we typically do.  

Personal sensing involves capturing all this information and using it to understand our recent experiences, preferences, and behaviors.  It can be used to predict how we feel right now, and even how we may feel or behave in the future.  

Right now, it is used primarily to sell us things.   But we hope to use it to improve mental healthcare.

---

My research team became interested in personal sensing when my colleague Dave Gustafson, the developer of a leading digital therapeutic for substance use disorders, approached us with a simple question. He asked...  

> "Could you predict not only who might be at greatest risk for relapse
> but **precisely when** that relapse might occur and 
> **how best to intervene** to prevent it"  

He had just completed a large study demonstrating the effectiveness of his app. However, he also noticed many of the people who relapsed hadn't used the app in the days leading up that relapse.  And others who relapsed hadn't used the specific supports in the app that he would have thought would be most effective.

He wondered if the benefits of his app could be increased further if it knew the person well enough to recognize when they were at greatest risk for relapse and if it was smart enough to recommend the specific supports that would be most effective for them at that moment in time.  

<!--the two paragraphs above are still a bit redundant and rough-->

This launched us on a new program of research to develop personal sensing algorithms that could accomplish these goals.

---

/gps_1.png

Let's "look under the hood" so to speak at two of the more revealing personal sensing methods that we are developing to provide you with some intuition about how this works.

Behind me is a wide view of my moment-by-moment location detected by my smartphone over a month when we were first experimenting with this personal sensing method.  You can see the paths that I traveled, with movement by car in yellow and running in blue.  

The points in red indicate places that I stopped to visit for at least a few minutes.  And although not displayed here, we know the days and exact times that I was at each location.  

As my smartphone ads already know, you can immediately see that I am runner, with long runs leaving from downtown Madison and frequent trail runs in the county and state parks to the west and northwest.

---

/gps_2.png

Zooming in to the Madison isthmus, you can see dense clusters of red dots indicating places visited near my home and where I work at the University of Wisconsin.  You can see that I drive my children clockwise around the lake each morning to their elementary school.  And you could detect those stressful mornings when getting my young kids dressed and fed didn't go as planned and we were late, sometimes very late, to school!

You can see my daily running commute to and from my office.  From this, you can observe the long days, and short days, at the office.   

If you probed the red dots indicating the places I visited, you would find the restaurants, bars, and coffee shops where I eat, drink and socialize.  We can use public map data to identify these places and make inferences about what I do there.  

<!--specific restaurants or cafes if humorous or personalizing-->

---

/text_messages.png

<!--Will remake for copyright-->

We also collect smartphone communications logs and even the content of text messages.  And no such luck, I don't plan to show you my actual text messages!

But imagine what you could learn about me if you knew the patterns of my communications - Who I was calling, when I made those calls, and even the content of what I sent and received by text message, in other words, my own words.  

---

/mom_raw.png

<!-- make this image funny with faces?  Talk with Kortney about her thoughts but could also just grab some faces from stock images-->

We can make these raw location and communications data more powerful still by discovering what these people and places actually mean to us.  

For example, this very same text message thread behind me would indicate quite different risk for relapse for someone in recovery when sent to their mother, who supports their recovery, vs. their drinking buddy who wants them back in the bar. 
<!--GEF: wondering if this is an opportunity to personalize - rather than showing two "strangers'" texts, could you make up an example that connects to Victor or your dad? -->

---

We can gather this information quickly by pushing out a few key questions to their smartphone about their frequent contacts and locations over the first couple of months of their use of the app. 

We can identify the specific people and places that make us happy or sad or stressed, those that we perceive support our recovery and those who undermine it. Armed with this information, our algorithms can make even more precise predictions.

---

For my dad, we could learn that his friend Ed has been a lifelong source of stability and support.  We would know my dad is doing well when he spends time at Ed's house, when they call and text each other to plan activities, when they go for daily walks along the beach by the Long Island Sound.  

We could also see when time spent with Ed abruptly stops each fall because Ed spends his winters in Florida.  These months are harder for my dad and he would benefit from more support.

He could be encouraged by the app to reach out to other supportive family and friends during these times.  He could be provided with locations and meeting times for support groups in his community.  He could even be assisted to build community in the discussion forums within the app itself.

If the app knew him well, it might even predict which of these forms of support would be most effective for him.

If he had also received traditional mental healthcare, he might have given permission for the app share his risk with his therapist.  His therapist might then increase their support when my dad was more isolated but direct their support preferentially to other patients when my dad was more stable and supported by his healthy friends and family.  

---

In our research studies, we can already predict if someone will drink tomorrow with relatively high accuracy based on personal sensing of their recent past experiences and behaviors.  

But these are **preliminary** research studies.  And we started with participants from our local Madison community.  And the samples were predominately white. Personal sensing algorithms trained on these participants would be unlikely to work well with black and brown patients or patients from rural communities.  

For example, we have all seen media reports on how AI facial analysis algorithms trained on images of predominantly light-skinned men fail catastrophically when used to classify even famous dark-skinned women like Oprah Winfrey or Michelle Obama.

We must commit to train our personal sensing algorithms on diverse samples of patients or our algorithms' predictions and recommendations will be biased toward the needs of the majority and we may exacerbate rather than reduce existing mental healthcare disparities. We can do better and we will.

/surprised_cat_1.png

I also suspect that at some point, probably about five minutes ago, you also thought: 

> "Holy crap, this is really private information that these apps would collect from me.  Who will have access to it and what will they do with it?"

Most of us are too familiar with recent egregious privacy violations including the Facebook Cambridge Analytica scandal and the more recent WhatsApp Pegasus Spyware scandal.

Given this, you might be surprised to hear me say that I am generally optimistic that we will get these privacy issues resolved, at least narrowly in the context of digital therapeutic apps.   I'm not making any promises for other apps on your phone or god forbid, Facebook! You're on your own there.....  

---

So here's why I'm optimistic

First, the business incentives for developers of digital therapeutics strongly encourage  them to adopt robust privacy protections to maintain the trust that is necessary for patients to accept their apps.  <!--"accept" is not quite the right word-->

For example, Woebot, the chatbot I briefly described earlier, started its life embedded within Facebook Messenger.  However, after the Cambridge Analytica scandal, the developers quickly pivoted to provide a stand alone app for Woebot so that they could maintain control over their user's data outside of Facebook servers.  Their data protection procedures now adhere to the standards set for personal health information by HIPAA.

---

/fda.png

But, of course, business incentives and voluntary compliance are not sufficient.  So more importantly, the FDA has begun to regulate software as it does other medical devices if the purpose of that software is to prevent, manage, or treat disease.  <!--awkward-->

This means that the FDA now evaluates both the effectiveness and risks, including privacy risks, of digital therapeutics before clearing them for use with patients.  

These FDA policy changes are huge and they situate digital therapeutics squarely within healthcare, where privacy protections have been considered paramount.  

<!--Updated clear guidance from the FDA was also designed to encourage increased investment and development of digital therapeutics by health and technology companies.-->  

And, in fact, the FDA has already followed through and recently cleared two new digital therapeutics to help people manage and treat substance use disorders.

<!-- still a bit of a rough transistion-->

<!-- slide that says:  “delivering the right treatments, at the right time, to the right person, every time”-->
<!--Talk with Kortney about attractive font and layout on slide for this and next panel-->

Digital therapeutics are here today.  

And as they begin to add personal sensing capabilities, we can start to imagine what precision mental healthcare might look like — “delivering the right treatments, at the right time, to the right person, every time”

<!--I havent used the term precision mental healthcare anywhere else.  But the name is somewhat self-defining?-->

---

<!-- Talk with Kortney about adding final line to above but in red?..    ".... and for all of us!"-->
My dad did not receive the mental healthcare he needed.  My hope is that digital therapeutics can help to break down barriers so that we can begin to provide mental healthcare that is accessible, acceptable, and available **for all of us**.  

Thank you.
