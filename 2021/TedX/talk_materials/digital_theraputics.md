# Digital Therapeutics in Mental Healthcare: Promise, Progress, and Pitfalls

We have a mental healthcare crisis in the U.S and our mental healthcare system is deeply flawed.  Our need for mental health services is alarmingly high and the practical capacity of our healthcare system to meet this need is woefully inadequate.

In 2019, the National Survey on Drug Use and Health estimated that 52 million adults ages 18 years or older suffered from some form of mental illness.  This represents almost 21% of the U.S. adult population[^fn_nsduh]. 

19 million adults had a major depressive disorder. More than 20 million adults had some form of substance use disorder.

In 2019 alone, the National Institute of Drug Abuse reported that  more than 70,000 people had died from opioid or other drug overdoses and this number has been increasing every year for the past two decades[^fn_overdose].

Almost 90% of those who die by suicide have an underlying mental illness[^fn_suicide] and suicide is the 10th leading cause of death in the U.S[^fn_death].

<!--Add more stats about cost of mental illness-->


We all likely know someone who is struggling with a substance use disorder or other serious, often debilitating, mental illness.  We are all touched in some way by this mental health crisis.  Unfortunately, although these numbers are tragic, they may not be that surprising to us.  

---

However, what may surprise you and candidly I think should upset you is that most people with mental illness do not receive treatment.  

One of out every three people with a major depressive disorder in the past year did not receive any treatment in that year.

And much worse, nine out of every ten people with a substance use disorder in the past year did not receive any treatment.

Furthermore, the surgeon general’s report on mental health has noted that the mental health care needs of our minority racial/ethnic groups remain largely unmet.  For example, African American & Hispanic Americans receive mental health services at about half the rate of whites[^fn_surgeongeneral].

Given the costs of ......

___

There are many reasons that the capacity of our mental healthcare system isn’t sufficient to meet our needs.

Access is one of the biggest.  Consider the 52 million people diagnosed with mental illness in any year and compare that to the approximately 100 thousand licensed psychologists (or 500 K licensed therapists if you consider therapists from other disciplines like counseling and social work and related areas).

---
Also consider that these therapists are not distributed evenly across the country and their distribution does not reflect the distribution of need.  These factors create a serious access problem

More than 60% of rural Americans live in mental health professional shortage areas.  More than 90% of all psychologists and psychiatrists, and 80% of MSWs, work exclusively in metropolitan areas[^fn_rural]

Then consider that even when therapists are available, the cost is often prohibitive, both because of limitations in insurance coverage for mental health services and for the many people from vulnerable groups that do not have insurance

Then consider the perceptions of stigma associated with seeking out help for mental illness and the perceived challenge of talking about the most intimate and personal details of your life with someone else.


All of these issues combine to make the practical capacity of our mental health system too low to meet the need.

---

However, I think we are poised for a paradigm shift in the treatments that we provide and the methods by which they are provided.

Specifically, I believe that AI, machine learning and related technologies are on the verge of producing a disruptive change in how we identify and treat psychiatric disorders.  

There are a number of related efforts in this area but I want to highlight two efforts that are far enough along to generate some excitement.

Talk about each briefly



I want to propose that a key feature of these new approaches is that they SCALE very well to increase capacity to provide interventions.  And with adequate SCALE, their effectiveness can be modest and they will still provide substantial aggregate benefit to reduce suffering from a population  health perspective.

Can address: 
cost [b/c they are inexpensive to implement and may reduce need of expensive time from therapists]

stigma (private, self directed)

Aid early diagnosis (efficient/massive diagnosis)

Improve effectiveness (could improve interventions by adapting to the person and moment in time)

I also want to emphasize that I am not talking about replacing human therapists.    These are primarily new tools that clinicians can use to supplement or augment the mental health services that they are providing.
