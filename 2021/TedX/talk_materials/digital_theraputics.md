# Digital Therapeutics in Mental Healthcare: Promise, Progress, and Pitfalls


## Our Mental Healthcare Crisis

We have a mental healthcare crisis in the U.S. and our mental healthcare system is deeply flawed.  Our need for mental health services is alarmingly high and the practical capacity of our healthcare system to meet this need is woefully inadequate.

---

<!--consider three pie charts against total adult population of 258.3 million in 2020. -->

In 2019, the National Survey on Drug Use and Health estimated that 52 million adults suffered from some form of mental illness.  This represents almost **21%** of the U.S. adult population[^nsduh]. 

19 million adults had a major depressive episode in that year. More than 20 million adults had some form of substance use disorder. 

And the costs of these mental illnesses are steep.

<!--Remake figure based on data table-->
<!--Second figure for 2020?-->
The Centers for Disease Control have documented steadily increasing numbers of deaths from opioid and other drug overdoses over the past two decades.  These were already sobering numbers with over 70,000 deaths in 2019 and almost 841,00 deaths over the full time period[^overdose].  However, we have just witnessed a staggering 34% increase over 2019, with more than 95,000 deaths from drug overdose in the past 12 months[^overdose_2020].  Let's pause to consider that loss of life.


<!--In 2019 alone, the National Institute of Drug Abuse reported that more than 70,000 people had died from opioid or other drug overdoses and this number has been increasing every year for the past two decades[^overdose].-->

<!--ADD 95,230 deaths in the last 12 month period reported by the CDC. A 34.8% increase; https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/drug-overdose-data.htm-->
---

Suicide is the 10th leading cause of death in the U.S.[^death] and almost 90% of those who die by suicide have an underlying mental illness[^suicide].

In 2010, the National Institute on Drug Abuse estimated the economic cost of drug abuse by itself in the United States at more than $740 billion a year and this cost was growing by more than 20 billion dollars each year due to the opioid crisis[^sud_cost].

Expanding our perspective globally, in that same year mental and substance use disorders constituted 10.4% of the global burden of disease and were the leading cause of years lived with disability among all disease groups[^global_burden].

We all likely know someone who is struggling with a substance use disorder or other serious, often debilitating, mental illness.  We are all touched in some way by this mental health crisis.  Unfortunately, although these numbers are tragic, they may not be that surprising to you.  

---

However, what may surprise you, and candidly I think should concern you, is that most people with mental illness in the United States do not receive treatment.  

One of out every three people with a major depressive episode in the past year did not receive any treatment in that year.

And much worse, nine out of every ten people with a substance use disorder in the past year did not receive any treatment.

Overall, well over half of individuals with any mental illness do not receive the care they need.

Furthermore, the surgeon general has noted that the mental health care needs of our minority racial/ethnic groups remain largely unmet.  For example, African American & Hispanic Americans receive mental health services at about half the rate of whites[^surgeongeneral].  

Similar mental healthcare disparities exist for people living in rural areas[^rural].  

<!--Need a strong concluding sentence or two before the transition to why-->

---

There are at least four key issues that severely limit the capacity of our mental healthcare system.  These are:

* Access,
* Availability,
* Affordability, and 
* Acceptability

---

**Access** is one of the biggest challenges.  Consider the 52 million people diagnosed with a mental illness in any single year and compare that to the only approximately 100 thousand licensed psychologists or 500 thousand licensed therapists if you include therapists from other disciplines.  There is a clear imbalance between the need for care and the number of trained mental healthcare providers.

---


/psychologist_heatmap.png
<!--edit figure title-->

But even more importantly, these therapists are not distributed evenly across the country and their distribution does not reflect the distribution of need.  For example, if you live in the southern or middle regions of our country, your access to psychologists is very limited.  

Also, this rural access issue is not limited to only psychologists. 61% of rural counties lack a psychologist but 80% of rural counties also do not have even a single psychiatrist; and 91% lack a psychiatric NP[^rural].   In fact, more than 90% of all psychologists and psychiatrists and 80% of MSWs work exclusively in metropolitan areas[^rural_2]. 

These factors create a serious access problem.

<!--may update image to gray and red cartoon characters-->
<!--need to buy copyright or remake image-->

For those of us who have geographic access to mental healthcare providers, **availability** poses the next issue.  Given the imbalance between the number of mental healthcare providers and the need for services, there are often long waits until care is available.  For example, in metropolitan Madison, WI, where I live, it is simply not possible to schedule at all with many well-regarded psychologists, and others have wait lists that can delay a first visit for months.  

---

/calendar.png

Furthermore, models for traditional individual or group psychotherapy still often revolve around weekly, monthly, or even less frequent appointments.  But, of course, our mental health needs aren't limited this these sparse appointment schedules.  Crises, stressors, strong drug cravings, and even drug relapses can occur and require support at any time.

---

When mental healthcare is nearby and available, **affordability** emerges as yet another serious issue for many people.  The cost for mental health services is often prohibitive, both because of limitations in health insurance coverage for these services and for the many people from vulnerable groups that still do not have any insurance at all.

There are also issues of **acceptability**.  Mental illness is still highly stigmatized in our society and this prevents many people from seeking necessary care.  For some, the need to talk about the most intimate and personal details of their life with someone else poses a barrier to seeking support. And in some instances, skepticism about the costs and/or benefits of particular treatments also limit their acceptability. 

All of these issues, access, availability, affordability, and acceptability, combine to make the practical capacity of our mental health system too low to meet our high need. 

And I would be tone deaf if I didn't acknowledge how the COVID pandemic has further highlighted the fragility of this system.  Over the last almost two years now, COVID has increased the need for services targeting substance use disorders and other mental illness.  At that the same time COVID has reduced access and availability to these services, increased problems of affordability because of the impact of job loss on health insurance[^insurance], and made face-to-face mental health services less acceptable to some because of the risks of contracting COVID.     

These are serious issues.  However, to my eye, our biggest problem is that many of these capacity limitations are "baked into the cake" of how we provide mental healthcare services.  It would be very hard to meaningfully address them to improve capacity within our current system without radically changing this system itself.    


## Disruptive Innovation in Mental Healthcare

<!-- Consider Slide: Bank teller vs. ATM-->

Fortunately, I believe we are now poised to experience disruptive innovation in the mental health services that we provide and the methods by which they are delivered.

I use the term **disruptive innovation** intentionally to signal the magnitude and nature of this potentially transformative change.  
 
As a classic example of disruptive innovation, consider the ATM.  I am old enough to remember having to go to the bank on payday to have a bank teller deposit my paycheck and provide me with cash to use for my weekly purchases.  And I remember the access and availability limitations associated with getting to the bank within bankers' hours; And planning for weekend spending, when I wouldn't have any access to the bank or my cash at all.  

Now I have 24/7 access to cash through ATMs that can be found almost everywhere.  And, of course, Venmo and similar digital payment technologies may soon provide further disruptive innovation to how we handle banking.

I believe that digital therapeutics, and in particular, digital therapeutics **delivered on smartphones and made smarter still by personal sensing technologies**, are positioned to disrupt and improve mental health services.  And I am not alone in this prediction.  The World Health Organization has also concluded that the use of digital health tools "has the potential to transform the face of health service delivery across the globe"[^who].

They will do this by targeting and addressing the issues in access, availability, affordability, and acceptability of mental health services that I've just highlighted for you.

However, I want to emphasize that I do not believe or hope that digital therapeutics will replace human clinicians.  We still have bank tellers after the introduction of the ATM.  The mix of services and tasks performed by these tellers has just shifted to what they do best.  As we increasingly adopt the use of digital therapeutics, I expect to see the same optimization of our use of mental healthcare providers for what they are uniquely positioned to do well.  Digital therapeutics will just extend their reach and impact.

I also want to be clear that these benefits are still only aspirational today.  We are in early days for digital therapeutics at this point.  

Now that I have made salient some of the problems with our current system for mental healthcare services, I want to use the rest of our time to first glimpse the promise and progress in the use of smart digital therapeutics.  But I also want to dig in a bit to the potential pitfalls that we need to navigate successfully to realize their promise and to not further compromise to mental health outcomes in the U.S. and globally.


 
## Digital Therapeutics

* Intervention and support apps delivered on smartphones
* Available 24/7 without geographic constraints
* Highly scalable and cost efficient
* Examples of DTs
	* CBT4CBT
	* A-CHESS
	* reSET & reSET-O
* Examples of interventions, tools and services
* Preliminary evidence of efficacy



So what are digital therapeutics?  

Digital therapeutics deliver evidence-based interventions through software programs to prevent, manage,or treat a medical disorder or disease. They are used independently or in combination with medications or other therapies to optimize patient care and health outcomes.  In our case, we will focus on mental health outcomes, although digital therapeutics are emerging across the healthcare system[^dta].

<!--merge pictures into one image-->

The term, digital therapeutic, is new but this approach to providing healthcare services is not.  In fact, much of this early work was pioneered here in Wisconsin, by my colleague David Gustafson at the University of Wisconsin's Center for Health Enhancement Systems Studies[^chess_center].  

In the 1980s, Dave and his center released a computer-based system to help adolescents deal with substance use, health and personal issues[^barn].  And soon afterwards, they developed and deployed the Comprehensive Health Enhancement Support System or CHESS, a suite of related but separate programs targeting specific chronic illnesses including breast cancer, HIV, and asthma.  A flagship program in this suite of digital therapeutics focused on recovery support for patients with substance use disorders.

/chess_laptop.jpg
<!--Need better image that highlights laptop and internet, maybe with SUD focus?-->

CHESS and other digital therapeutics slowly evolved with changes in technology across the 90s and the aughts.  The software moved from the desktop to laptop computers, and eventually to the Internet.  

However, both the development and the potential impact of these digital therapeutics remained limited because computers were expensive, and many  people didn't have access to them or to broadband Internet connections.

<!--plot of ownership combined with simple tables?-->
<!--Show only smartphone data from this plot; https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/fact-sheet/mobile/-->

/smartphone_ownership.png

```
<!--Smartphone Ownership by Key Demographics 

White	            85%
Black	            83%
Hispanic	        85%

Urban	            89%
Suburban	        84%

$50,000-$74,999	    85%
$75,000+	        96%
```

This changed with the advent and proliferation of the smartphone.  The Pew Research Center has documented a steady and rapid rise in smartphone ownership over the last 10 years[^pew].  85% of adults in the U.S. now carry these pocket-sized, powerful, Internet-connected computers with them everywhere they go. This positioned digital therapeutics delivered on smartphones to be highly accessible and available 24/7.

Equally important, smartphone ownership is already relatively high and increasing even for people from minority racial/ethnic groups, rural communities, and those with lower income.  This makes it at least possible, given proper development, for digital therapeutics on smartphones to reach the groups that experience the greatest mental health disparities.

Not surprisingly given this, we have now seen an explosion in development, research and implementation of digital therapeutics for substance use disorders and other mental illness.

The Veterans Health Administration has been at the forefront of this implementation effort.  

The VA is the U.S.'s largest integrated health care system, serving 9 million enrolled Veterans each year[^va] and its 2024 strategic objectives include a focus on the the delivery of mental health services through digital therapeutics and related technologies[^va_plan].  As part of this effort, it has developed and distributed a suite of 15 digital therapeutics that provide evidence-based treatments and self-management strategies for post-traumatic stress disorder, substance use disorders and other mental illness[^va_dtx].

These interventions may extend therapeutic contact beyond traditional in-person services and can be delivered in a cost-effective manner.7
Ben-Zeev D, Razzano LA, Pashka NJ, Levin CE. Cost of mHealth versus clinic-based care for serious mental illness: same effects, half the price tag. Psychiatr Serv. 2021;72(4):448-451.

Dr. David H. Gustafson and colleagues developed an interactive program to interview severely depressed people to predict the risk of suicide. They discovered that patients in deep personal distress preferred to "talk" openly to a computer over a person. That was the first hint for the researchers that computers could provide support to people in crisis.

## Synergies between Digital Therapeutics and Personal Sensing

<!-- Org Question: Not sure how to organize these ideas yet but this section will highlight that: 1) Digital theraputics on smartphones make personal sensing feasible, given access to sensors, software and computing power, 2) Personal sensing makes digital theraputics smarter, allowing for its supports (treatments, tools & services) to be tailored to person, place, and time, 3) Personal sensing can also encourage greater engagement with both digital theraputics and traditional mental healhcare services, and  4) Digital theraputics can provide conduit for risk and symptom sensing back to health care providers to allow for efficiet resource allocation based on momentary need.  May need to focus or curtail these ideas-->
