# Digital Therapeutics in Mental Healthcare: Promise, Progress, and Pitfalls


## Our Mental Healthcare Crisis

Let me start with some sobering statements.  We have a mental healthcare crisis in the U.S. and our mental healthcare system is deeply flawed.  Our need for mental health services is alarmingly high and the practical capacity of our healthcare system to meet this need is woefully inadequate.

---

<!--consider three pie charts against total adult population of 258.3 million in 2020. -->

In 2019, the National Survey on Drug Use and Health estimated that 52 million adults suffered from some form of mental illness.  This represents almost **21%** of the U.S. adult population[^nsduh]. 

19 million adults had a major depressive episode in that year. More than 20 million adults had some form of substance use disorder. 

And the costs of these mental illnesses are steep.

/overdoses.png  
<!--Remake figure based on data table-->
<!--Second figure for 2020?-->
The Centers for Disease Control have documented steadily increasing numbers of deaths from opioid and other drug overdoses over the past two decades.  These were already sobering numbers with over 70,000 deaths in 2019 and almost 841,00 deaths between 1999 and 2019[^overdose].  However, we have just witnessed a staggering additional 34% increase over 2019, with more than 95,000 deaths from drug overdose in the past 12 months[^overdose_2020].  Let's pause to consider the immense personal impacts of this loss of life.

<!--In 2019 alone, the National Institute of Drug Abuse reported that more than 70,000 people had died from opioid or other drug overdoses and this number has been increasing every year for the past two decades[^overdose].-->

<!--ADD 95,230 deaths in the last 12 month period reported by the CDC. A 34.8% increase; Or 93K in the 2020 calendar year.  https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/drug-overdose-data.htm-->

[^overdose_2020]: https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/drug-overdose-data.htm

---

Moving beyond overdoses, suicide is the 10th leading cause of death in the U.S.[^death] and almost 90% of those who die by suicide have an underlying mental illness[^suicide].

In economic terms, the National Institute on Drug Abuse estimated the cost of drug abuse by itself in the United States at more than $740 billion in 2010 and this cost was growing by more than 20 billion dollars each year due to the opioid crisis[^sud_cost].

---

Expanding our perspective globally, in that same year mental and substance use disorders constituted 10.4% of the global burden of disease and were the leading cause of years lived with disability among all disease groups[^global_burden].

We all likely know someone who is struggling with a substance use disorder or other serious, often debilitating, mental illness.  We are all touched in some way by this mental health crisis.  Unfortunately, although these numbers are tragic, they may not be that surprising to you.

Lancet 382: 1575–1586.

---

However, what may surprise you, and candidly I think should concern you, is that most people with mental illness in the United States do not receive treatment[^nsduh].  

One of out every three people with a major depressive episode in the past year did not receive any treatment in that year.

And much worse, nine out of every ten people with a substance use disorder in the past year did not receive any treatment.

Overall, well over half of individuals with any mental illness do not receive the care they need.

---

Furthermore, the surgeon general has noted that the mental health care needs of our minority racial/ethnic groups remain largely unmet.  For example, African American & Hispanic Americans receive mental health services at about half the rate of whites[^surgeongeneral].  

Similar mental healthcare disparities exist for people living in rural areas[^rural].  

<!--Need a strong concluding sentence or two before the transition to why-->

---

There are at least four key issues that severely limit the capacity of our mental healthcare system.  These are:

* Access,
* Availability,
* Affordability, and 
* Acceptability

---

**Access** is one of the biggest challenges.  Consider the 52 million people diagnosed with a mental illness in any single year and compare that to the only approximately 100 thousand licensed psychologists or 500 thousand licensed therapists across disciplines.  There is a clear imbalance between the need for care and the number of trained mental healthcare providers.

---


/psychologist_heatmap.png
<!--edit figure title-->

But even more importantly, these therapists are not distributed evenly across the country and their distribution does not reflect the distribution of need.  For example, if you live in the southern or middle regions of our country, your access to psychologists is very limited.  

Also, this rural access issue is not limited to only psychologists. 61% of rural counties lack a psychologist but 80% of rural counties also do not have even a single psychiatrist; and 91% lack a psychiatric NP[^rural].   In fact, more than 90% of all psychologists and psychiatrists and 80% of MSWs work exclusively in metropolitan areas[^rural_2]. 

These factors create a serious access problem.

[^rural_2]: https://www.ruralhealthinfo.org/topics/mental-health

---

/waitlist_2.jpg
<!--may update image to gray and red cartoon characters-->
<!--need to buy copyright or remake image-->

For those of us who have geographic access to mental healthcare providers, **availability** poses the next issue.  Given the imbalance between the number of mental healthcare providers and the need for services, there are often long waits until care is available.  For example, in metropolitan Madison, WI, where I live, it is simply not possible to schedule at all with many well-regarded psychologists, and others have wait lists that can delay a first visit for months.  

---

/calendar.png

Furthermore, models for traditional individual or group psychotherapy still often revolve around weekly, monthly, or even less frequent appointments.  But, of course, our mental health needs aren't limited this these sparse appointment schedules.  Crises, stressors, strong drug cravings, and even drug relapses can occur and require support at any time.

---

When mental healthcare is nearby and available, **affordability** emerges as yet another serious issue for many people.  The cost for mental health services is often prohibitive both because of limitations in health insurance coverage for these services and for the many people from vulnerable groups that still do not have any insurance at all.

There are also issues of **acceptability**.  Mental illness is still highly stigmatized in our society and this prevents many people from seeking necessary care.  For some, the need to talk about the most intimate and personal details of their life with someone else poses a barrier to seeking support. And in some instances, skepticism about the costs and/or benefits of particular treatments also limit their acceptability. 

All of these issues, access, availability, affordability, and acceptability, combine to make the practical capacity of our mental health system too low to meet our high need. 

And I would be tone deaf if I didn't acknowledge how the COVID pandemic has further highlighted the fragility of this system.  Over the last almost two years now, COVID has increased the need for services targeting substance use disorders and other mental illness.  At that the same time COVID has reduced access and availability to these services, increased problems of affordability because of the impact of job loss on health insurance[^insurance], and made face-to-face mental health services less acceptable to some because of the risks of contracting COVID.     

These are serious issues.  However, to my eye, our biggest problem is that many of these capacity limitations are "baked into the cake" of how we provide mental healthcare services.  It would be very hard to meaningfully address them to improve capacity within our current system without radically changing this system itself.

## Disruptive Innovation in Mental Healthcare

<!-- Consider image: Bank teller vs. ATM-->

Fortunately, I believe we are now poised to experience disruptive innovation in the mental health services that we provide and the methods by which they are delivered.

I use the term **disruptive innovation** intentionally to signal the magnitude and nature of this potentially transformative change.  
 
As a classic example of disruptive innovation, consider the ATM.  I am old enough to remember having to go to the bank on payday to have a bank teller deposit my paycheck and provide me with cash to use for my weekly purchases.  And I remember the access and availability limitations associated with getting to the bank within bankers' hours; And planning for weekend spending, when I wouldn't have any access to the bank or my cash at all.  

Now I have 24/7 access to cash through ATMs that can be found almost everywhere.  And, of course, Venmo and similar digital payment technologies may soon provide further disruptive innovation to how we handle banking.

I believe that digital therapeutics, and in particular, digital therapeutics **delivered on smartphones and made smarter still by personal sensing technologies**, are positioned to disrupt and improve mental health services.  And I am not alone in this prediction.  The World Health Organization has also concluded that the use of digital health tools "has the potential to transform the face of health service delivery across the globe"[^who].

They will do this by targeting and addressing the issues in access, availability, affordability, and acceptability of mental health services that I've just highlighted for you.

[^who]: https://www.who.int/goe/publications/goe_mhealth_web.pdf

---

However, I want to emphasize that I do not believe or hope that digital therapeutics will replace human clinicians.  We still have bank tellers after the introduction of the ATM.  The mix of services and tasks performed by these tellers has just shifted to what they do best.  As we increasingly adopt the use of digital therapeutics, I expect to see the same optimization of our use of mental healthcare providers for what they are uniquely positioned to do well.  Digital therapeutics will just extend their reach and impact and by extension the overall capacity of our mental healthcare system.

I also want to be clear that these benefits are still only aspirational today.  We are in early days for digital therapeutics at this point.  

Now that I have made salient some of the problems with our current system for mental healthcare services, I want to use the rest of our time to first glimpse the promise and our progress in the use of smart digital therapeutics.  But I also want to dig in a bit to the potential pitfalls that we need to navigate successfully to realize their promise and to not further compromise to mental health outcomes in the U.S. and globally as we expand their use.

## Digital Therapeutics

So what are digital therapeutics?  

Digital therapeutics use software programs to deliver evidence-based interventions to prevent, manage,or treat a medical disorder or disease. They are used independently or in combination with medications or other therapies to optimize patient care and health outcomes.  In our case, we will focus on mental health outcomes, although digital therapeutics are emerging across the healthcare system[^dta].  

[^dta]: https://dtxalliance.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/DTA_DTx-Definition-and-Core-Principles.pdf

---

/barn.png

The term, digital therapeutic, is new but this approach to providing healthcare services is not.  In fact, much of this early work was pioneered here in Wisconsin, by my colleague David Gustafson at the University of Wisconsin's Center for Health Enhancement Systems Studies[^chess_center].  

In the 1980s, Dave and his center released a computer-based system to help adolescents deal with substance use, health and personal issues[^barn].  And soon afterwards, they developed and deployed the Comprehensive Health Enhancement Support System or CHESS, a suite of separate but related programs targeting specific chronic illnesses including breast cancer, HIV, and asthma[^chess_app].  A flagship program in this suite of digital therapeutics focused on recovery support for patients with substance use disorders. 

[^chess_center]: https://center.chess.wisc.edu/home
[^barn]: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/6443961/
[^chess_app]: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1482860/

---

<!--Consider image that highlights laptop and internet, maybe with SUD focus?-->

CHESS and other digital therapeutics slowly evolved with changes in technology across the 90s and the aughts.  The software moved from the desktop to laptop computers, and eventually to the Internet.  

However, both the development and the potential impact of these digital therapeutics remained limited because computers were expensive, and many people didn't have access to them or to broadband Internet connections.

<!--plot of ownership combined with simple tables?-->
<!--Show only smartphone data from this plot; https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/fact-sheet/mobile/-->

/smartphone_ownership.png

```
<!--Smartphone Ownership by Key Demographics 

White	            85%
Black	            83%
Hispanic	        85%

Urban	            89%
Suburban	        84%

$50,000-$74,999	    85%
$75,000+	        96%
```

This changed with the advent and proliferation of the smartphone.  The Pew Research Center has documented a steady and rapid rise in smartphone ownership over the last 10 years[^pew].  85% of adults in the U.S. now carry these pocket-sized, powerful, Internet-connected computers with them everywhere they go. This positioned digital therapeutics delivered on smartphones to be both highly accessible and available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.

Equally important, smartphone ownership is already relatively high and increasing even for people from minority racial/ethnic groups, rural communities, and those with lower income.  This makes it at least possible, given proper development and a strong commitment, to develop digital therapeutics on smartphones that reach those groups that experience the greatest mental health disparities.

Not surprisingly given these advances in computing technology, we have now seen an explosion in research, development, and implementation of digital therapeutics for substance use disorders and other mental illness.

<!-- Draft image;  Need to consider which apps to highlight. Consider apps featured in https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6087876/#!po=78.1250; apps are here: https://mobile.va.gov/appstore/all -->

The Veterans Health Administration has been at the forefront of this implementation effort.  

The VA is the United States' largest integrated health care system, serving 9 million Veterans each year[^va] and its 2024 strategic objectives include a focus on the delivery of mental health services through digital therapeutics and related technologies[^va_plan].  

As part of this effort, it has developed and distributed a suite of 20 digital therapeutics that provide evidence-based treatments and self-management strategies for post-traumatic stress disorder, substance use disorders, and other mental illness.  These digital therapeutics are targeted at veterans but the VA makes them freely available to everyone[^va_dtx].

[^va_dtx]: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6087876/

---

There has also been substantial development outside of the VA on digital therapeutics for substance use disorders.  

The CHESS digital therapeutic developed by Dave Gustafson that I highlighted earlier remains available and has been used by at least 60 treatment centers nationwide. 

A team of researchers and clinicians at Yale University led by Kathleen Carroll developed CBT4CBT, a digital therapeutic that teaches cognitive and behavioral skills that can help people gain control over their use of alcohol or other drugs. 

<!-- “CBT4CBT can extend the clinician’s reach and improve outcomes by replacing or supplementing clinician-delivered therapy. CBT4CBT is a user, friendly, engaging, broadly accessible, cost-effective means of providing access to empirically validated cognitive behavioral therapy.” -->

And as yet another example, Lisa Marsch and the Dartmouth Center for Technology and Behavioral Health developed the Therapeutic Education System or TES.  TES focuses on cognitive behavioral skills training such as effective strategies for refusing drugs and managing thoughts about drug use.  It also includes tools for self-management and planning.

---

<!-- Develop image of a few of these apps with their icons for tools & services-->

More generally, there are a handful of key features and supports provided by many digital therapeutics today in the mental health domain.

These include:

* Specific interventions like cognitive behavioral therapy that target specific mental illnesses
* Interventions designed to increase well-being generally like guided meditation and guided stress reduction and relaxation modules
* Curated access to mental health relevant psycho-educational materials
* Peer support in the form of discussion forums and peer-to-peer messaging.  Digital therapeutics targeting substance use disorders can also locate self-help groups like AA and NA meetings.
* Healthcare planning tools such as medication managers, appointment scheduling, and appointment reminders are often included.  
* Self-assessment and symptom tracking tools are generally included
* Clinician dashboards are also emerging that can allow both bi-direction communication with healthcare providers and patient symptom tracking by clinicians

/ellie.jpg
/woebot.png

On the more leading or even bleeding edge, there has been recent rapid developments of virtual relational agents that use artificial intelligence based natural language processing to communicate more naturally while providing support for mental illnesses.

For example, Ellie is a virtual interviewer developed by the Institute for Creative Technologies (ICT) at the University of Southern California.  "She" has been designed to gather information that can be used by human clinicians for diagnosis and treatment decisions.

And Woebot is a chatbot designed by Stanford-trained researchers and psychologists that uses brief, text-based conversations and tools based on CBT and related interventions to provide psycho-education and guided support with cognitive distortions, thought reframing, emotional awareness needs for people struggling with depression and anxiety.  

---

By their very nature, digital therapeutics on smartphones can meaningfully address issues of access and availability as smartphone ownership continued to increase overall and in under-served groups.  These digital therapeutics can be accessible and available anywhere, 24/7.  

<!--Could use some cites here-->
Digital therapeutics are highly scalable and in many instances can provide interventions at substantially reduced costs compared to traditional mental healthcare[^costs]. This **could** address affordability issues for patients but the devil is in the details of who provides the digital therapeutics to patients and how are they paid for.  This will be important to track in the coming years as their use becomes more and more mainstream.

[^costs]: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33557599/

---

/ptsd_coach_app.png

The available evidence for the acceptability of digital therapeutics by patients is very encouraging.  

For example, there were over 150,000 downloads of the VAs PTSD coach[^ptsd_coach] in the first three years after its release in 2011 and over 60% of its users engaged with it on multiple occasions[^ptsd_coach_use].  And this was in the early days of smartphones. Its use has only increased since then[^ptsd_coach_use_now].

A recent review of the suite of VA digital therapeutics concluded there is strong evidence of their feasibility and acceptability among veterans[^dt_acceptability].

[^ptsd_coach_use]: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26543913/

---

Beyond their overall acceptability, there is emerging evidence that digital therapeutics might begin to address limitations resulting from stigma or related barriers to disclose or engage with mental health services.

In his early work, Dave Gustafson and colleagues developed an interactive program to interview severely depressed people to predict their risk of suicide. They discovered that patients in deep personal distress preferred to "talk" openly to a computer over a person[^computer_talk]. 

[^computer_talk]: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/4585280/

---

/ellie.jpg

More recently, researchers had participants interact with Ellie, the virtual interviewer I described earlier, in the context of health-screening interviews.  The participants were led to believe that Ellie was controlled by either a human or automation and when the believed they were interacting with a computer, they reported lower fear of self-disclosure, lower impression management, displayed their sadness more intensely, and were rated by observers as more willing to disclose[^ellie_disclose]. 

[^ellie_disclose]: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0747563214002647

---

/woebot.png

In another study, over 36,000 adult users who received digital CBT from Woebot reported on the quality of their therapeutic bond with the chatbot using a standard self-report measure called the Working Alliance Inventory[^woebot_bond].  Within 5 days of initial use, their working alliance overall score and their mean bond score were comparable to scores typically seen in research on traditional, outpatient, individual CBT and group CBT.  This meant that participants reported that they *fairly often* or *very often* felt  

* Woebot likes me.
* Woebot and I respect each other.
* Woebot appreciates me.
* Woebot cares about me even when I do things that they do not approve of.

[^woebot_bond]: https://www.jmir.org/2021/3/e24850

---

<!--Need a concluding sentence or two about this that also transitions to effectiveness-->

---

Of course, it would be meaningless if digital therapeutics were accessible, available, affordable and acceptability if there were not effective tools to help people with substance use disorders and other mental illness.

The gold standard for evidence of treatment effectiveness is the randomized controlled trial or RCTs where patients are randomly assigned to receive the treatment in question vs. a control condition that does not include that treatment.

These RCTs are now being conducted for many digital therapeutics.

---

The VA's PTSD Coach use resulted in significantly greater improvements in symptoms of PTSD and depression as well as overall psychosocial functioning relative to a waitlist control condition[^ptsd_rct]

[^ptsd_rct]: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28221061/

---

To evaluate Dave Gustafson's CHESS digital therapeutic, patients receiving residential care for alcohol use disorder were randomized to treatment as usual or that same treatment + CHESS.   Twelve months later, patients using CHESS had less than half as many risk drinking days and their odds of total abstinence was approximately 60% higher[^chess_rct].

[^chess_rct]: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4016167/

An RCT for the therapeutic education system documented comparable benefits when added to 12 weeks of outpatient treatment for substance use disorders.  Patients using TES had 60% higher odds of abstinence at end of treatment[^tes_rct].  They were also dropped out of outpatient treatment at lower rates than did patients not using TES.    .

## Smarter Digital Therapeutics with Personal Sensing

The potential of digital therapeutics arises from easy, 24/7 access to their rich and diverse set of interventions, tools, and services.

But this is also their challenge.  As the patient you now have to tackle difficult questions like:

* When should I use them?
* For how long?
* Which of these various supports are right for me?
* And which are right for me **now**, at this moment in time?

This is why the next wave of digital therapeutics must get smarter to realize their full potential.  And they will do this through the use of artificial intelligence powered personal sensing.

<!-- Not sure about the need to invoke AI.   The hook is to smarter digital therapuetics but maybe too obscure and unnecessary -->

---

"Personal sensing refers to collecting and analyzing data from sensors embedded in the context of daily life with the aim of identifying human behaviors, thoughts, feelings, and mental health symptoms"[^sensing].

---

/smartphone.png

Much like digital therapeutics themselves, personal sensing has been supercharged by the proliferation of smartphones and the raw data that  smartphones collect about us.

Smartphones log our personal communications by phone calls and text messages. Facebook posts, Instagram photos, tweets, and other social media activities are often created or viewed through our smartphones. Smartphone-embedded sensors know our moment-by-moment location and activity level.  Sensors can even detect other people, or at least their smartphones, in our immediate environment.  And much of this is done passively without any burden to us other then carrying and using our smartphones as we typically do.  

Personal sensing involves capturing all these raw data streams, deriving predictive features from these data, and submitting them to machine learning algorithms to characterize our recent experiences and behaviors, predict how we feel right now, and even predict how we may feel or behave in the future.  

---

My research team is one of a handful who have been funded by the National Institutes of Health to develop the foundation for personal sensing within digital therapeutics to help patients with substance use disorders.

We have two active grants from the NIH that focus on patients in recovery from alcohol use disorder and opioid use disorder, respectively.

We started this research when Dave Gustafson approached my team with a simple question. He asked...  

> "Could you predict not only who might be at greatest risk for relapse
> but critically, precisely WHEN that relapse might occur."

If done well, this would open up a world of possibilities within digital therapeutics for substance use disorders.  

Not least among these is the possibility to deliver interventions "just-in-time", in other words, both at the moments of greatest need and when these interventions are predicted to be most effective.  

---

/gps_1.png

Let me highlight two particularly exciting data streams we are studying to help you develop an intuition for how this works.  

First, personal sensing of people's moment by moment location using smartphone location services offers a potentially clear window into their daily lives, their day-to-day activities, and their overall health, both physical and mental.  

Behind me is a wide view of my own movement patterns over a two-month period when we were first developing this personal sensing method.  You can see the paths that I traveled, colored by how I was traveling, with travel by car in yellow and running in blue.  The points in red indicate places that I stopped to visit for at least a few minutes.  And although not displayed in this map, all of these points are time-stamped so that we know the day and exact time that I was at each location.  

You can immediately see that I am runner, with long runs leaving from downtown Madison and frequent trail runs in the county and state parts to west and northwest.  You could learn these patterns and also detect if events in my life disrupted these these patterns.

---

/gps_2.png

Zooming in to the Madison isthmus, you can immediately see dense clusters of red dots indicating places visited near my home and where I work at the University of Wisconsin.  You can see that I drive my children clockwise around the lake each morning to their elementary school.  And you could detect those stressful mornings when getting my young kids dressed and fed didn't go as planned and we were late, sometimes very late, to school!

You can see my daily running commute to and from my office.  From this, you can observe the long days, and short days, at the office.   

If you probed the red dots indicating the places I visit, you would find the restaurants, bars, and coffee shops I frequent to eat, drink and socialize.  You could identify the homes of my friends, and the stores where I shop.  These are already very rich data.  You could see when my life was filled with healthy and rewarding social activities.  You might also see periods of social isolation during bouts with depression or high stress.

<!--Can still tune these examples above-->

---

/text_messages.png
<!--Will edit for copyright and to more clearly convey stressor of having phone stolen-->

We also collect smartphone communications logs and text message content.  And no, I don't plan to show you my actual text messages!

But imagine what you could learn about me if you knew the patterns of my communications - Who I was calling, when I made those calls, and even the content of what I sent and received by text message, in other words, my own words.  You might see the late sleepless nights, particularly if you also logged all the use of my smartphone.  You might see my messages sharing joys or stressors, like when my expensive phone was stolen.  Natural language processing could be used to extract the meaning of my words and use this to make inferences about my recent experiences, emotional state, and even psychiatric symptoms. 

---

These raw location and communications data that we sense directly from the smartphone are powerful signals for prediction right out of the box.  But we can make them more powerful still by anchoring them within a longitudinal context. 

Personal sensing draws some of its power from repeated measurements of the same person over days, weeks, months, and even years.  It is the change in our patterns that are often most meaningful.  We stop going to work briefly for a vacation or we stop for a longer period when we lose our job. 

Or we start or re-start late night calls and text messages after a period of successful recovery when we had established more healthy behaviors and lifestyle. 

<!--consider better examples-->

---

<!--Slide: Text message with "Mom" vs. "Joe Party-Party".  "I'm really stressed and I am want to use....   Can you help me?   Yes, I am home right now.  Come over as soon as you can"-->

We can engineer even more sensitive predictive features from these data by wrapping them in an intra-personal subjective context.  In other words, what do these people and places mean to us?

For example, this very same text message thread behind me may indicate quite different risk for relapse when sent to your mother, who supports your recovery, vs. a friend who still regularly engages in drug use themselves <!-- or "...who wants you back at their parties" if that seems more acceptable info to gather without unpacking-->.  

We have demonstrated that we can gather this context quickly and with little burden to the patient by pushing out a few key questions to their smartphone about their frequent contacts and places over the first couple of months of their use of the digital therapeutic. It turns out that we are all creatures of habit, and we only have a small number of people we talk to regularly and places we visit.  

For people, we can ask if they support the patient's recovery. For places, we can assess its subjective risk to their recovery, and their typical activities at that location.   For both people and places, we can ask if their associated experiences are generally pleasant or unpleasant.

<!-- Maybe a map with clear indications of my house, my office, and a few key public bars and health care facilities??  -->

We can further flesh out the context for places using their spacial-temporal features and publicly available map data that are often sufficient to identify our home, our workplace, and commercial spaces, like bars, restaurants, liquor stores, healthcare facilities and the like.

Our preliminary analyses have already demonstrated that we can use predictive features derived from contextualized personal sensing to determine the probability of a future lapse within the next 24 hours with high accuracy.  We are now working actively to increase the temporal precision of these predictions from the day to the exact hour when the lapse starts and from tomorrow to next week.

If patients knew their future risk, they could plan accordingly.  They could increase their use of their digital therapeutic or step up their traditional clinical care when their risk of relapse was high or increasing.  

Patients could also opt in to share their risk with their healthcare providers though their digital therapuetic's clinician dashboard.  This would allow clinicians to efficiently direct their own limited resources toward their patients with greatest need.

Once we can predict relapse risk using personal sensing, we can also begin to ask and even more important question.

What interventions or other supports are optimal for a specific patient at a specific moment in time to reduce their risk.  

For example, if recent poor sleep is contributing to their risk, interventions to improve sleep hygiene or reduce stress could be delivered.  

If they have slipped back into interactions with unhealthy peers, they could be encouraged to re-engage with peer support groups within the digital therapeutic or provided with information about upcoming local AA or NA meetings.  

During moments of peak craving, they could be distracted by engaging video games until their craving subsides as it usually does.  Immediate contact with designated supportive family or sponsors could also recommended and facilitated.

With digital therapeutics and personal sensing, we can start to imagine what precision mental healthcare might look like — “delivering the right treatments, at the right time, to the right person, every time”[^pmh]

## Pitfalls and Prescriptions
* How paid for?  Answer dictates other issues
	* Privacy
		* [Cambridge Analytica](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambridge_Analytica)  
		* [Israeli Pegasus Spyware](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pegasus_(spyware))
		* Who has access to the data and who benefits?  How are commercial apps supported?
	* Evidence based vs. the wild west
	* Gamification or other techniques to encourage constant use vs. optimal  use
* Burden
	* Active vs. passive personal sensing
* Disparities reified by Artificial Intelligence Algorithms (e.g., Weapons of Math Destruction)  <!-- Slide: Book cover image?-->
* Shelf life <!-- Slide: Expired or rotting food on shelf or in frige?  ;-)-->
* Integration into clinical care.  
 	* Replace vs. supplement clinical care
	* Feedback.   
	* Encourage treatment retention.

I am here today to say that these goals are possible, if not today, in the coming years as we continue to develop these two technologies.

However, there is no guarantee we will acheive this ....
