## The Mental Healthcare Crisis
<!--Image of my dad?-->

When I was still relatively young, my mother lost control of her car when it hit a patch of ice two days before Christmas.  Her car spun off the road, her seat collapsed, and she experienced a traumatic brain injury.  She survived but she never recovered.  She required full-time care for the rest of her life.  My dad devotedly stayed home for 25 years rather than work so that he could care for her at home rather than commit her to an institution. My dad is a good man.      

My dad is a good man who he has struggled with his use of alcohol for his entire adult life. At times, it was in the background of our lives.  At other times, it was severe and almost impossible to ignore. But we did. He is almost 80 years old now and he has never received any treatment.  This is heartbreaking, but it is not surprising.

While caring for my mom at home, his **access** to mental healthcare was limited by its high cost without health insurance through a job.  

Even if he had had access to treatment, it likely wouldn’t have been **acceptable** to him. Like many men of his generation, asking for help from others and sharing personal problems wasn’t his strong suit. But **even our family** never discussed it.  It was the elephant in the room.

And had he received treatment, that treatment may not have been **available** to him at his moments of greatest need - when he lost a job due to downsizing, or shortly after my mom's car accident, or on the many dark mornings when he woke up with his hands shaking and had to decide if he was going to drink again to steady them. 

My dad is a good man, and he suffered, and he suffered without support from our mental healthcare system. In large part, my work now is driven so that others don't suffer similarly.

<!--image of country with 52 million people?-->

We have a mental health crisis in the U.S., and it’s a crisis of **high need**.  

More than **one in five adults** suffer from some form of mental illness including substance use disorders. 

---

<!--image Sarah and Victor?-->
And in the past 12 months alone, almost **100,000 people** have died from drug overdoses.  One of them was the brother of my graduate student, who died from an opioid overdose this past spring.

---

We have a mental health crisis, and more precisely, it is a crisis of **unmet** high need because our delivery of mental healthcare is deeply flawed.

In 2019, well over half of the individuals in the U.S. with an active mental illness did not receive **any** treatment.  **More than half**!  

And for those suffering with a substance use disorder in that same year, **9 out of 10 people** did not receive any treatment at all.  

---

Our failure to treat is even more troubling for vulnerable groups.  African American & Hispanic Americans receive mental healthcare services at about half the rate of whites.  

And similar mental healthcare disparities exist for people living in rural areas and for those with lower incomes.

---

**Access** , **acceptability**, and **availability** - these are the factors that undermine our mental healthcare system.  You can see them in my dad’s story, but you can see them in the stories of others as well.

---

/psychologist_heatmap.png
<!--edit figure title-->

My dad’s access to services was limited by their cost. But consider the **access** to mental healthcare for the farmer in rural Kansas, when more than 90% of all psychologists and psychiatrists and 80% of social workers work exclusively in metropolitan areas and predominately on the coasts.

---

/stigma_1.png
<!--consider this figure and buy-->

Seeking out mental health treatment is **unacceptable** to many of us because mental illness is still highly stigmatized and making ourselves vulnerable by sharing our most intimate thoughts and feelings with a therapist is hard.  

<!--GEF: consider incorporating what we talked about, how difficult it was for you to be willing to share your dad's story, and you study this. -->

/waitlist_2.jpg
/calendar.png
<!--combine images and maybe panel and order by point-->

Mental healthcare services are often not **available** when we need them most.  Many well-regarded psychologists have long wait lists that can delay the start of treatment for months.  

And once we make it off the wait list, treatment still often involves weekly, monthly, or even less frequent appointments with a therapist.  But our mental health needs aren't limited this these sparse, pre-scheduled appointments.  Crises, stressors, strong drug cravings and other dark thoughts and emotions can occur and require support at any time.

## Digital Therapeutics

Access, acceptability, and availability - these issues are undermining our mental healthcare system and leaving millions without treatment when they need it most.  

Fortunately, digital therapeutics, and in particular, digital therapeutics **delivered on smartphones and made smarter still by personal sensing technologies**, are now emerging to target these very same three issues.  

___

But let me pause for a moment.  I want to be very clear on one point before we move forward.  I do not believe or even hope that digital therapeutics will replace human clinicians. 

* Digital therapeutics provide **new tools** that are not part of traditional mental healthcare delivered by human clinicians
* Digital therapeutics can provide a safety net for people who are not receiving traditional care now. 
* Digital therapeutics may reduce barriers for some people that later eases them into traditional care.  
* And digital therapeutics can optimize traditional care to extend its reach and impact while allowing clinicians the time to provide what they uniquely do well. 

Human clinicians will always be needed but we simply need more than they can provide alone.  Digital therapeutics can provide that "more."

So what are digital therapeutics, you ask?

Digital therapeutics are software programs or "apps" that are designed to prevent, manage, or treat a medical disorder. 

<!--consider distinguishing them from broader category of digital health apps?-->
---

/barn.png
<!--Still use image but with caption to indicate early CHESS?-->

Digital therapeutics **delivered on computers** have been around since the 1980s but their impact remained limited because computers were expensive and many people didn't have access to them.

This all changed with the smartphone.  Raise your hand if you have a smartphone with you in your pocket or purse?  

<!-- Pull out my smartphone from my pocket and hold it up-->

And now keep your hand raised if you've just now realized you forgot to silence it & are trying to do so now without us noticing!

<!--plot of ownership combined with simple tables?-->

/smartphone_ownership.png

```
Smartphone Ownership by Key Demographics

Overall	                85%

Black	                83%
Hispanic	            85%
Rural	                80%
Income < $30,000/year	76%
```

Today, 85% of adults in the U.S. own smartphones.  And ownership is already relatively high and increasing even for people from vulnerable groups including minority racial/ethnic groups, rural communities, and those with lower income.  

Most of us now carry these pocket-sized, powerful, Internet-connected computers with us everywhere we go.


And its this widespread use of smartphones that has powered a surge in research, development, and implementation of the first wave of digital therapeutics that can now provide us support
* 24 hours a day, 
* 7 days a week, 
* every day of the year,
* regardless of where we live, 
* and wherever we go

<!-- Need an engaging image to make the transition and highlight diversity of tools and services.   Cartoon/sketch?-->

<!-- Need to improve the text in this panel.   Want to make clear there are rich/varied supports but need to make it more interesting!-->

Some of the best examples of these digital therapeutics have been developed to support patients with alcohol and other substance use disorders.  They include a rich set of interventions, tools, and services to support patients during their recovery.

These include:

* Evidence-based interventions like cognitive behavioral therapy
* Interventions designed to increase well-being or reduce stress like guided meditation
* Curated psycho-educational materials about substance use and mental health
* Peer support in the form of discussion forums with other patients using the app
* Search tools to locate self-help groups like AA and NA meetings
* Healthcare planning tools such as medication managers, appointment scheduling, and appointment reminders
* And self-assessment and symptom tracking tools

Clinician dashboards are also being developed to allow communication with healthcare providers.  These dashboards can also allow clinicians to track their patients' symptoms in real time.

And on the more leading edge, some digital therapeutics now use virtual agents that can talk to patients in a more natural way while they provide support.  

<!--And the emerging evidence suggests that patients can develop bonds with these virtual agents that can approach what we see human therapists.-->

---

Of course, all of this would be meaningless if digital therapeutics were not effective.

But they are.  

For example, patients using digital therapeutics have about double the odds of remaining abstinent from alcohol or other drugs.

These increases in abstinence from using digital therapeutics are observed when compared to patients on wait lists, who have yet to gained access to treatment.  

But these increases in abstinence are also observed when digital therapeutics are added on top of traditional treatments for substance use disorders.

And these benefits are durable - they have been documented up to 12 months after the start of treatment.  

Furthermore, emerging evidence suggests that the use of digital therapeutics can also increase retention in traditional treatments for substance use disorders.  This highlights again that digital therapeutics can complement rather than compete with care offered by human clinicians.

/smartphone_crowd.png

I want to pause here for a moment more to make sure you develop an important intuition at this point about digital therapeutics.  

The magnitude of the benefits I just described are meaningful already, even when we only think about a single patient.  

But their true power is in their scale, when these benefits from these apps are multiplied because they are provided simultaneously to millions of people in need.  

This is how we can increase the treatment capacity of our mental healthcare system.

This is how we will see substantial improvement in public mental health overall.

## Smarter Digital Therapeutics with Personal Sensing

<!-- Image representing challenge of choosing what to do-->
<!--version 1.0-->

OK, so lets call the apps I have described to you so far, Digital Therapeutics 1.0.

Their power arises from easy, 24/7 access to their rich and diverse set of interventions, tools, and services.

But this is also their Achilles heel.  As the patient you now have to tackle difficult questions like:

* When should I use them?
* For how long?
* Which of their various supports are right for me?
* And which are right for me **now**, at this moment in time?

---

This is why the next wave of digital therapeutics, digital therapeutics 2.0, must get smarter to realize their full potential.  They must get smarter and they must learn to know us better as individuals, not just a group of patients with the same crude diagnosis.  

And they will do this through the use of artificial intelligence powered personal sensing.
<!-- GEF: I would cut the AI reference. Just say through personal sensing.-->

<!-- invoke the personal piece here as well.  They need to see more than just a diagnosis, - patient with substance use disorder.  They need to know us as individusl so that....  -->

---

<!--  Make this more plain english-->
"Personal sensing refers to collecting and analyzing data from sensors embedded in the context of daily life with the aim of identifying human behaviors, thoughts, feelings, and mental health symptoms".

---

<!-- "John, er... excuse me....sorry to interprut but I'm still in your pocket and your apple watch and I have been noticing your high heart rate.  We think I should lead you through some guided meditation to relax after you get off the stage"-->

<!-- GEF: this is funny!! Include this. I would put it at the end of the next "slide" (i.e., after "even predict how we may feel or behave in the future")-->
/smartphone.png

Much like digital therapeutics themselves, personal sensing has been supercharged by smartphones and the raw data that smartphones collect about us through their many sensors and logs

Smartphones log our personal communications by phone calls and text messages. Facebook posts, Instagram photos, tweets, and other social media activities are often created or viewed through our smartphones. Smartphone-embedded sensors know our moment-by-moment location and activity level.  Sensors can even detect other people, or at least their smartphones, in our immediate environment.  And much of this is done passively without any burden to us other then carrying and using our smartphones as we typically do.  

Personal sensing involves capturing all these raw data streams, deriving predictive features from these data, and submitting them to machine learning algorithms to characterize our recent experiences and behaviors, predict how we feel right now, and even predict how we may feel or behave in the future.  

---

My research team is one of a handful who have been funded by the National Institutes of Health to develop the foundation for personal sensing within digital therapeutics to help patients with substance use disorders.

We started this research when Dave Gustafson approached my team with a simple question. He asked...  

> "Could you predict not only who might be at greatest risk for relapse
> but critically, precisely **when** that relapse might occur."  

If done well, this would open up a world of possibilities within digital therapeutics for substance use disorders.  

Not least among these is the possibility to deliver interventions "just-in-time", in other words, both at the moments of greatest need and when these interventions are predicted to be most effective.

/gps_1.png

And I can help you develop a solid intuition for how this works by looking a bit more closely at two of the more revealing personal sensing methods we are developing.  

First, sensing people's moment by moment location using their smartphone can provide a clear window into their daily lives, their day-to-day activities, and their overall health, both physical and mental.  

Behind me is a wide view of my movement patterns detected by my smartphone over a two-month period when we were first developing this personal sensing method.  You can see the paths that I traveled, with travel by car in yellow and running in blue.  The points in red indicate places that I stopped to visit for at least a few minutes.  And although not displayed here, we know the day and exact time that I was at each location.  

You can immediately see that I am runner, with long runs leaving from downtown Madison and frequent trail runs in the county and state parts to the west and northwest.  Running makes an important contribution to both my physical and mental health. You could learn these patterns and also detect if events in my life disrupted these patterns.

---

/gps_2.png

Zooming in to the Madison isthmus, you can immediately see dense clusters of red dots indicating places visited near my home and where I work at the University of Wisconsin.  You can see that I drive my children clockwise around the lake each morning to their elementary school.  And you could detect those stressful mornings when getting my young kids dressed and fed didn't go as planned and we were late, sometimes very late, to school!

You can see my daily running commute to and from my office.  From this, you can observe the long days, and short days, at the office.   

If you probed the red dots indicating the places I visit, you would find the restaurants, bars, and coffee shops I frequent to eat, drink and socialize.  You could identify the homes of my friends, and the stores where I shop.  You could see when my life was filled with healthy and rewarding social activities.  You might also see periods of social isolation during bouts with depression or high stress.

<!--Can still tune these examples above-->

<!--specific restaurants or cafes if humorous or personalizing-->

/text_messages.png
<!--Will edit for copyright and to more clearly convey stressor of having phone stolen-->

We also collect smartphone communications logs and text message content.  And no, I don't plan to show you my actual text messages!

But imagine what you could learn about me if you knew the patterns of my communications - Who I was calling, when I made those calls, and even the content of what I sent and received by text message, in other words, my own words.  You might see the late sleepless nights, particularly if you also logged all the use of my smartphone.  You might see my messages sharing joys or stressors, like when my expensive phone was stolen.  Natural language processing could be used to extract the meaning of my words and use this to make inferences about my recent experiences, emotional state, and even psychiatric symptoms. 

---

These raw location and communications data that we sense directly from the smartphone are powerful signals for prediction right out of the box. But personal sensing draws additional power from repeated measurements of the same person over days, weeks, months, and even years.  It is the change in our patterns that are often most meaningful.  We stop going to work briefly for a vacation or we stop for a longer period when we lose our job. We stop or restart going to AA meetings or to our therapist.  

Or we start late night calls and text messages after a period of successful recovery when we had established more healthy behaviors and lifestyle. 

<!--consider better examples-->
<!-- GEF: consider personal example of fewer/no runs would be a big red flag for you. Also could use this to get across the idea that you already know the impact not running has on you, but there may be other things you wouldn't be able to know just intuitively-->
---

<!--Slide: Text message with "Mom" vs. "Joe Party-Party".-->

/mom_raw.png

We can engineer even more sensitive predictive features from these data by discovering what these people and places mean to us.

For example, this very same text message thread behind me may indicate quite different risk for relapse when sent to your mother, who supports your recovery, vs. a friend who wants you back in the bar with them. <!-- better description? "...who wants you back at their all-night parties"-->.  

We can gather this information quickly and with little burden to the patient by pushing out a few key questions to their smartphone about their frequent contacts and locations over the first couple of months of their use of the digital therapeutic. It turns out that we are all creatures of habit, and we only have a small number of important people and places in our lives.

We can identify the specific people and places that make us happy or sad or stressed, those that we perceive support our recovery and those who undermine it. Armed with this information, we can gain more precise insights into your patterns of movements and social communications. <!-- GEF: i think you can delete the next two sentences and go straight to patterns changing--> Are they healthy or unhealthy, rewarding and rich, or stressful or isolating.  Do the people you surround yourself with support your recovery or tempt you back to old ways.  And how have these patterns changed, for better or for worse, over recent days, weeks, and months.  

<!--need pronouns and consistent focus on target we are sensing-->
---

<!-- Maybe a map with clear indications of my house, my office, and a few key public bars and health care facilities??  -->

We can further flesh out the meaning for specific places passively using their spacial-temporal features and publicly available map data that are often sufficient to identify our home, our workplace, and commercial spaces, like bars, restaurants, liquor stores, healthcare facilities and the like.  

---

Our preliminary analyses have already demonstrated that we can use predictive features derived from this enriched personal sensing to determine the probability of a future lapse within the next 24 hours with high accuracy.  We are now working actively to increase the temporal precision of these predictions from the day to the exact hour when the lapse starts and from tomorrow to next week.

If patients knew their future risk, they could plan accordingly.  They could increase their use of their digital therapeutic or step up their traditional mental healthcare when their risk of relapse was high or increasing.  

Patients could also opt in to share their risk with their healthcare providers though their digital therapeutics's clinician dashboard.  This would allow clinicians to efficiently direct their own limited resources toward their patients with greatest need.

---

Once we can predict relapse risk using personal sensing, we can also begin to ask an even more important question.

> What interventions or other supports are optimal for a specific
> patient at a specific moment in time to reduce their risk?

For example, if recent poor sleep is contributing to their risk, interventions to improve sleep hygiene or reduce stress could be delivered.  

If they have slipped back into interactions with unhealthy peers, they could be encouraged to re-engage with peer support groups within the digital therapeutic or provided with information about upcoming local AA or NA meetings.  

During moments of peak craving, they could be distracted by engaging video games until their craving subsides as it usually does.  Immediate contact with designated supportive family or sponsors could also recommended and facilitated.

<!--If I dropped pitfalls section, I could instead highlight the key ones that are clear without unpacking here-->

With digital therapeutics and personal sensing, we can start to imagine what precision mental healthcare might look like — “delivering the right treatments, at the right time, to the right person, every time”

<!--One more sentence to tie back as addressing the mental health crisis-->
<!--GEF: These advances would allow us to tackle the issues of access, acceptability, and availability currently plaguing mental healthcare. Armed with digital therapeutics and personal sensing, we can get help to the untreated individuals who need support and care, when and where they need it most.-->

## Pitfalls and Prescriptions


The use of personal sensing in smart digital therapeutics may help us tailor the support they provide. Personal sensing AI algorithms can recommend and deliver the optimal supports based on characteristics of the patient, their environment, and their recent experiences.  However, these algorithms must be trained on diverse samples of patients - black and brown patients, patients from rural communities. If we fail to do this, the algorithms' recommendations will be biased toward the needs of the majority and we may exacerbate rather than reduce existing health disparities. 

<!-- consider issue of shelf life and need for ongoing evaluation -->

But if we succeed, smart digital therapeutics will become important tools to reduce our mental health crisis broadly while also addressing intolerable disparities in health outcomes.   

<!--Need more powerful end!-->

<!--Too late for my dad.  I hope we can do better for my son and daughter if they need support in the future.  Images?-->
