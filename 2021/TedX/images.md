# Info from TedX
Utilize the 16:9 orientation. It is also best if you use a black or dark background and bright or white text. (Because the theater is dark, this contrast works best - switching them overwhelms the eyes of the audience.) The fewer slides the better - the fewer words the better. Best if they are submitted in PowerPoint format - not Keynote or Prezi formats.
